There doesn\u2019t appear to be a connection, and his interpretation is incorrect.\r\n* Alex claims hCG comes from the ovaries and testicles.

It is about [https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/ some dark moments in American history] that involve sterilization, but still is unrelated to the claims he\u2019s presenting.\r\n* Alex\u2019s Fourth Headline doesn\u2019t make his argument.

The Gates Foundation stayed involved in the program afterwards, and according to Alex, Gates should have been thrown out of India at this point already.\r\n* Alex\u2019s Sixth Headline doesn\u2019t make his argument.

It is a product of the Population Research Institute, which is disqualifying on its face.\r\n* Alex\u2019s Eighth Headline doesn\u2019t make his argument. It is just Alex saying \u201ccontraceptive vaccines,\u201d which is meaningless.\r\n* Alex\u2019s Ninth Headline doesn\u2019t make his argument. He just says \u201cSpecial Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction\u201d and pretends it\u2019s something he\u2019s read.

It is [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)60336-4/fulltext an article about opposition to birth control shots in India]. Alex claims that this 1998 article involves the HPV vaccine, which did not exist until 2006.\r\n* Alex\u2019s Eleventh Headline doesn\u2019t make his argument. There are two articles titled \u201cAntifertility Vaccines\u201d on Science Direct. One of them is just [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471490602021828 the same article as his Second Headline], which he already cited when it was posted on a different website. The other is [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0264410X89900431 a 1989 article by Gursaran Talwar] about his research into birth control shots.\r\n* Alex\u2019s Twelfth Headline doesn\u2019t make his argument.

[https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/did-lego-pull-products-featuring This is not true], and is just a dumb propaganda narrative that was pushed by Trump\u2019s campaign staff, and failed congressional candidate Deanna Lorraine.\r\n* Alex has learned how to pronounce the name Bolsonaro.\r\n* Alex wants to outlaw \u201cliberalism,\u201d which he seems to think means democrats, which it does not.\r\n* Alex reads the Wikipedia page for Ochlocracy, thinking he\u2019s reading the definition of Oligarchy. He doesn\u2019t know what any of these words mean, and is just pulling things out of his ass.\r\n* A caller from Northern Ireland thinks that Trump\u2019s election was prophesied by the Illuminati Card Game. This is very silly.\r\n* A caller explains to Alex that his skull, chess board and rose could be easily interpreted as an occult altar, based on her experience as a former occult follower. Alex explains he was just trying to get attention.\r\n",

No evidence for this is provided, and it seems more likely that he was removed because he was investigating Trump\u2019s associates.\r\n* Alex interviews a guy named Larry Gaiters, who claims that various words have completely made up roots. He says that \u201cnegro\u201d comes from the Greek word \u201cnecro\u201d ([https://www.etymonline.com/word/negro it does not]) and that the word media comes from the Hebrew word for witches.\r\n* Alex misrepresents [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/ an Atlantic article from May] about Covid test reporting inconsistencies. He claims that numbers are all just being made up, but this article is about how there were some states that were reporting negative results to viral and antibody tests as a single figure, which makes the data difficult to interpret. This was brought up, and corrected.\r\n* Alex [https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408.pdf lies about a study] about how cities that had Black Lives Matter protests in them actually saw increased social distancing behavior, and it may have helped decrease transmission. Alex hasn\u2019t read the study, and is just making up what it says.\r\n* Alex realized that he did a bad job on his regular show, so he returns in the evening to do a 2 hour special emergency report about Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s arrest. He seems very drunk, says nothing meaningful, rants about his ex-wife, almost starts crying a few times, and bails with half an hour left in the planned show. It was an absolutely embarrassing and childish display, but far from the worst Alex has been on air.\r\n",

The president's story about the circumstances of his firing were communicated inconsistently by the president and his surrogates. Many believed it was an attempt to impede the investigation of Trump's ties to Russia. Others balked at the idea and thought the firing was a result of Comey's incompetence.</li><li>Grand juries had been convened, possibly about some Trump associates (Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Jeff Sessions, etc), and the FBI executed at least one search warrant on a GOP fundraising organization, the Strategic Campaign Group. Though on the surface, it may appear to have nothing to do with Trump's 2016 campaign, Strategic Campaign Group has close connections with Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and most ominously, with right-wing billionaire hedge fund manager/campaign purse, Robert Mercer.</li></ul><p>What Alex Jones decided to cover:</p><ul><li>A very large portion of the show is taken up ranting about a video that Keith Olbermann released through GQ. Olbermann's video was a plea to foreign intelligence agencies to release whatever information they may have on Donald Trump.

    "citations_mediawiki": "The world on May 12, 2017:\r\n\r\n* FBI Director James Comey had recently been fired by President Trump. The president's story about the circumstances of his firing were communicated inconsistently by the president and his surrogates. Many believed it was an attempt to impede the investigation of Trump's ties to Russia. Others balked at the idea and thought the firing was a result of Comey's incompetence.\r\n* Grand juries had been convened, possibly about some Trump associates (Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Jeff Sessions, etc), and the FBI executed at least one search warrant on a GOP fundraising organization, the Strategic Campaign Group. Though on the surface, it may appear to have nothing to do with Trump's 2016 campaign, Strategic Campaign Group has close connections with Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and most ominously, with right-wing billionaire hedge fund manager/campaign purse, Robert Mercer.\r\n\r\nWhat Alex Jones decided to cover:\r\n\r\n* A very large portion of the show is taken up ranting about a video that Keith Olbermann released through GQ. Olbermann's video was a plea to foreign intelligence agencies to release whatever information they may have on Donald Trump.

    "citations_mediawiki": "The world on Jan 19, 2017:\r\n\r\n* This was the last day before Donald Trump would officially be inaugurated as president. Many attempts had been made to avoid that turn of events, from lobbying the Electoral College, to Jill Stein's attempts at recounts, but the inevitable came to pass.\r\n* In one of his last days in office, President Obama commutes the sentence of Chelsea Manning.\r\n* Trump's pick for Secretary of The Interior, Ryan Zinke said in his confirmation hearing that he would consider reviewing the ban on arctic drilling.\r\n* Trump's pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos was caught in a couple tough situations in her confirmation hearing. The first was when she claimed that she was listed as the Vice President of her mother's foundation on tax forms for multiple years due to a &quot;clerical error.&quot; The other was the revelation that she and her husband have investments in student debt collection agencies.\r\n* Almost 60 members of Congress announce their intention to not go to Trump's inauguration.\r\n* People are out protesting pipelines in Texas, Tennessee, Florida, and North Dakota.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening with Alex Jones:\r\n\r\n* Alex was broadcasting from Washington D.C. in anticipation of the inauguration of Donald Trump. This was to be a culmination of everything he had worked so hard for, but Alex's thoughts were clearly elsewhere. Instead of enjoying this victory, Alex spent almost his entire show implying that Democrats were planning not to show up because they had foreknowledge of a terrorist plot against the ceremony.\u00a0\r\n* Alex claimed on this episode that the way that the Democrats (or Globalists) would take out Donald Trump was C.O.G. (Continuity of Government). Continuity of Government is a term that describes having a plan for the government to continue in crisis situations. Most world governments have established orders of succession in place, and our Continuity of Government plans date back to the earliest days of our country, when we were worried about the British capturing our heads of state or even the entirety of the Continental Capital city of Philadelphia. What C.O.G. is not is a plan to assassinate a leader, it is a formulated plan to make sure that our actual government survives attacks. It sounds kind of smart to dumb people though, so Alex ran with it.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Alex, sensing that it is too late for anyone to do anything about it, reveals that Donald Trump has been an Anti-Globalist sleeper cell since the 60's. It's an absurd idea, and looks very embarrassing in hindsight. This revelation continues into Alex being really weirdly defensive about people thinking he hates gay people. He also is sick of black people thinking he hates black people, and he admits that his ancestors owned slaves. It's a confusing road.\r\n\r\n* Alex does his world-famous impression of Cookie Monster.\r\n\r\n* Alex continued his persecution complex, going so far as to suggest that &quot;people from the Establishment&quot; have been hissing at him while he's been in DC. I cannot prove that this hissing incident did not happen, but I am certain it did not happen at all how Alex describes\r\n\r\n* As a show of impartiality, Alex (along with Rob Dew) gives a very subtle plug for Trump's new hotel on his broadcast. It was, undoubtedly, an unpaid advertisement.\r\n",

    "citations_mediawiki": "The world on June 18th, 2015:\r\n\r\n* On the evening of June 17th, Dylann Roof entered Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and murdered nine people in cold blood. He would be apprehended on the morning of the 18th, and it subsequently came out that his motivation was entirely based on a racist ideology. He explained that he had hoped to start a race war, and that one of his primary motivations was his sense that black people were taking over &quot;our country.&quot; He would go on to be sentenced to death for his horrendous crimes.\r\n* Donald Trump, a day after announcing his candidacy for president, utters his now famous words:\u00a0\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nWhat Alex Jones covered on June 18th:\r\n\r\n* It is Alex Jones standard operating procedure to immediately call any major event (especially traumatic ones) a false flag. He is generally quick to point the finger at the Globalists, but in this case, I think even Alex could tell that this was going to be a pretty tough sell for him to make on his own. Thus, he started out the show with a fairly ambivalent tone about whether or not it was a staged mass murder:\r\n\r\n* Alex plays the &quot;maybe it was fake, maybe it wasn't&quot; game for most of the episode until, toward the end of the show,\u00a0he conducts and interview with Rev. Childress. Childress goes on to make all the points Alex felt he could not earlier in the show, and by doing so, he essentially gives Alex permission to expand the narrative, call the event fake (or at least planned), and make it all about how the Gobalists want to take away guns.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Over the course of the show, Alex seeks to find ways to deflect from the reality that a horrible racist mass murder had happened, and he didn't really have a great spin for it. In order to attempt to move his listeners attention elsewhere, he frequently tries to downplay the Charleston murders because they pale in comparison to the number of abortions that are performed. Multiple times, he says that, if Roof were serious about killing black people, he should have gone to work at Planned Parenthood. It's hard to tell if he thinks he's being funny or poignant, but easy to tell he's succeeding in being neither.\r\n\r\n* He goes on to develop this theme further and suggests that secretly, when they're not being recorded, that liberals support abortion because it kills black people that they don't want to support. The way he delivers this piece of information reinforces my belief that the person he's talking about does not exist, and that these genocidal liberals he's seen off-camera are a figment of his paranoid imagination.\r\n\r\n* Alex goes on to further deflect from the reality of the Charleston murders by listing off people who have been &quot;mind controlled&quot; to do terrible things in the past, including but not limited to Timothy McVay, The Aurora Batman Shooter, and the Unabomber. Most of these cases are far from conclusive, vis-a-vis &quot;mind-control.&quot;\r\n* Alex also takes the opportunity to demonize medications, being as Roof was apparently on Suboxone. While it is true that many medications are over-prescribed, and some regulations should be in place to safeguard from that, it is irresponsible to paint psychiatric drugs with such a broad brush. Medications can have negative side effects, but the way Alex couples medication and losing your free will is dangerous, and could scare people away from life-saving drug treatments.\r\n* Dylan Roof made comments about how he felt that black men were &quot;taking our women.&quot; Instead of engaging with this belief as a piece of a racist cosmology that is really more about misplaced hated than it is about sexual impotence, Alex responds primarily by calling Roof a weirdo who couldn't get a girlfriend. The implication here is that if he could have gotten a girlfriend, he would not have harbored dangerously racist beliefs, which is just not true.\r\n\r\n* Paul Joseph Watson filed a &quot;special report&quot; about how white people are the real victims in society.\r\n* Alex gave the first indications that he is aware that the 2016 election season was starting, as he conducted an interview with former Clinton associate Larry Nichols. The interview is mostly Nichols talking about how evil both Clintons are, and how if they don't like you, they will kill you like Vince Foster. This interview is critical, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n# The entire interview is about how if Hillary Clinton becomes president, the world will end. Everything will be destroyed. Alex had these ideas before, but there is a sense that he is also getting new marching orders, or at very least starting to understand that the narrative has to be destroy Hillary to save the world.\r\n# It is now two days after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the office of the president.

It appears that he conceived of the sketch in response to Rachel Dolezol (a story that broke on June 12, a full 10 days prior), but it misses the mark entirely and ends up being an exercise in cruel mockery of anyone who doesn't fit the mold that white, Christian, patriarchal society deems normal. It is such an embarrassment that Alex cuts it off in the middle, claiming it was &quot;too racy&quot; (also because he didn't bleep the n-word)\r\n\r\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1495858015458-O3K4WOYI3PL0Z7RK9S4S/image-asset.jpeg|thumb|none]]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Paul Joseph Watson, perhaps to make up for the swing-and-a-miss of his trans sketch, claims that there is no rape culture in the West, and that no one seems to care that there are problems with rape in a bunch of other cultures. He goes on to explain that there is no gendered wage gap and that Hillary Clinton is running for president on feminist lies.\r\n\r\n* Alex believes that the Globalists are trying to distract people from TPP by getting them riled up about the Confederate flag, so to offset that, he embarks on a very interesting retelling of the Civil War, which includes a very bizarre and unsettling brag that &quot;rednecks who know stuff bow down to me.&quot; This narrative that the Civil War wasn't really about slavery, and that it was about tariffs, has been [https://imperialglobalexeter.com/2015/03/02/debunking-the-civil-war-tariff-myth/ thoroughly debunked], and contradicts South's own secession convention documents (Fun Fact: [http://historymuse.net/readings/mississippiresolsecession.html Mississippi's Resolution of Secession] mentions &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;slavery&quot; ten times, but never once mentions &quot;tax&quot; or &quot;tariff&quot;; [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp South Carolina's] mentions slaves 18 time and &quot;tax&quot; once, but in a sentence about taxing slaves). There are plenty of other deeply flawed, subtly racist inaccurate claims Alex makes in this clip, but probably too many to list here. At this point, making these sorts of arguments is a definite indication of either: a) being completely misinformed, or b) holding slavery-apologist beliefs (or both)\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Alex Jones has still not mentioned that Donald Trump is running for president.\u00a0\r\n",

One of the escaped prisoners was killed by the police, and the other apprehended.\r\n* Puerto Rico announces that it will not be able to pay off its $72 billion in national debt.\r\n\r\nOur episode covering the June 29th edition of The Alex Jones Show:\r\n\r\nWhat Alex Jones covered on June 29th:\r\n\r\n* Alex believes that the Democrats are using radicals to shift the Overton Window further toward degeneracy and progressive ideals. He uses the example of Jocelyn Elders and evidence that this is something that the left does, not taking into account what Ms. Elders actually said, or the context of her comments that normalized masturbation.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Alex indicates that he is against the sanctions placed on Russia for their annexation of Crimea.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Alex spends a lot of the show spreading fear about the financial situation in Greece. While the situation in Greece was very troubling, Alex's coverage appears to be mostly motivated by a desire to convince his audience that the global currency market is about to collapse, in anticipation of his &quot;interview&quot; with Midas Resources owner Ted Anderson on July 2.\r\n* Alex plays a video of Mark Dice asking people on a beach to sign his petition to create a new national flag. The video is nonsense, however the way it is covered is illuminating. The process goes like this:\r\n\r\n# Alex posts the video of Mark Dice's report on InfoWars website\r\n# The Drudge Report picks up the video and posts a link to it with the headline being something along the lines of &quot;Liberals Call To Ban American Flag&quot;\r\n# Alex, to better frame his coverage of the video on his radio show, reports on the link that is in the Drudge Report as opposed to the video itself. As such, Alex's reporting is about liberals calling to ban the flag, instead of what the video actually is, namely Mark Dice annoying people on a beach and a few of them politely signing the petition so he will leave them alone.\r\n# The &quot;news&quot; cycle is complete. Alex posts something, it is warped by Drudge, and then Alex is able to report on the new fun-house mirror version of the original thing he posted. This is literal propaganda.\r\n\r\n* Alex conducts an interview with Lionel, the one-named pundit. Lionel lays out a plan for how he feels the liberals/Globalists would destroy our country. With hindsight, it is startling how similar this plan is to what Donald Trump would go on to do/reinforce as president.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Alex has still not mentioned that Trump is running for president\r\n",

Further, consider these two videos, each pointing out very serious problems with Alex Jones' Bohemian Grove documentary.

On this episode, he explains his media routine, and it seems to mostly include reading stories posted on InfoWars (his own website), and reading the comments looking for &quot;tips.&quot; It is a fascinating glimpse into how even the man making all the money and controlling the organization is still hurt by the influence of propaganda.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Because Alex has worked himself up into such a bad mood by reading dishonest stories on his own website, he is in no shape to actually do a show. He spends most of the show taking callers who all agree with him.\r\n* In the middle of a jag about how he doesn't want people to make him feel &quot;white guilt,&quot; Alex reveals that even Jerome Corsi, a man who has known Donald Trump for 40 years, has told Alex that Trump is a shill. Everyone who eventually comes to support Trump are going on record as having inside knowledge that he's not to be trusted.\r\n\r\n* Alex tells a story about hanging out with Willie Nelson that is supposed to explain that Alex sells quality products because he doesn't want people to boo him, but ends up revealing that he is a bit of a prude.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Alex conducts an interview with &quot;trends researcher&quot; Gerald Celente. A lot of it is about the impending financial collapse, and they do recommend that people buy gold, a recurring theme on programs supported by Genesis Communications Network.\r\n",

As it turns out, what this means is that Alex still doesn't trust Trump, but that he is going to stop bringing up that he is a mob-connected, slimy casino owner. What changed his mind was apparently watching a couple YouTube videos over the past weekend. It becomes clear, in hindsight, that someone told him to stop talking about the mob ties. Alex makes clear that he doesn't endorse him, just that he's going to stop talking shit. Given the astounding levels of self-censorship Trump has bullied the press into imposing on themselves, I would not be surprised if this was an early example of that.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n* Alex explains that no one else can see the Globalists because they are incapable of seeing such evil or even admitting that kind of evil exists in the world. This is insane.\r\n\r\n* The Center For Medical Progress has begun releasing heavily edited anti-Planned Parenthood propaganda videos, and Alex cannot get enough of them. The videos would go on to net their creators multiple felony charges for videotaping people without their consent (all those charges are still pending at the time of this writing).

It's pretty clear that what he wants to do is cast himself as Jonathan Swift as he makes his very own Modest Proposal, but Alex does not realize that he is not making a logical point at all. He thinks he's making a shocking statement that's backed up by logic, but in reality, he's just exposing his own poor grasp on reality and his extreme hatred of Muslims.</p><p>In his essay, Swift used the suggestion of the poor selling their babies to be eaten by the rich as a way to highlight and mock how horribly the rich treated the poor already. It is an exaggeration made by heightening an already existing problem.</p><p>Conversely, Alex Jones' \"modest shark jump\" is him calling for the deportation of every Muslim, the banning of all mosques, and all Muslim symbols, ostensibly using the logic that \"some people want to ban the Confederate flag, so why not ban all Muslim things?\"</p><p>Here, he falls into a number of logical traps. I will list them out for you:</p><ol><li>In order for this to be satire (he claims that he is not being satirical, he is just using logic, but I disagree), he would need to be satirically advocating a position that he does not already tacitly support. He has many times in the past expressed deeply held feelings of distrust toward the Muslim community, and has often conflated radical terrorists with the general Muslim population. This is not an instance of him making a headline-grabbing statement to point out a social problem, it's him reaching the logical conclusion of his beliefs. He wants to outlaw Islam, and is using this weak argument as a shield to give him cover to express that.</li><li>If he wants to use this \"Shark Jump\" to start a conversation, it's a flawed premise. He acts like people want to ban the Confederate flag, therefore it makes sense for him to call for other iconography to be banned. But, the reality is that people were calling for Confederate flags to be taken down from government buildings, so the only real outcome that can come from this conversation is the conclusion that Islamic flags should also not be flown at government buildings, which I think most people already agree on.</li><li>Even if people were calling for the banning of the Confederate flag, which they were not, it still doesn't logically track for that to be analogous to banning Islamic iconography. In order for them to be equivalent, Alex would need to first make the argument that the Confederate flag was a religious symbol, and the Confederacy a religion, thereby making them logically relatable. I grant, flying a Confederate flag on your property is protected as free speech, but the argument of \"they want to ban A, so I suggest we ban B too\" doesn't work under these conditions. Also, people weren't trying to ban the Confederate flag.</li><li>But, Alex is not just calling for the banning of Islamic iconography. In his thought experiment, he is proposing essentially outlawing a religion, which he sees as being analogous to banning a Confederate flag. Just taken in terms of scale, this is pretty unfair as far as comparisons go.</li><li>He tries to use logic to make his argument, but he clearly has no experience in using actual logic. If you don't look at what he's saying, and you're already a bigot, his words may make sense to you. The problem is, the argument he's making is substantially more complicated than he thinks it is, as I attempt to lay out below:</li></ol><ul><li>Premise A: Terrorism being carried out by Muslims hurts people (\"A Muslim has hurt someone\")</li><li>Premise B: The Charleston shooting carried out by a white person hurt people (\"A white person has hurt someone\")</li><li>Premise C: All white people are blamed for the actions of one white person in the Charleston Shooting (\"If one white person has hurt someone, all white people are to blame\")</li><li>Premise D: If all white people are blamed for the Charleston Shooting, then all Muslims should be blamed for things that any individual Muslim does.\u00a0</li><li>Premise E: If a group is blamed for the actions of an individual member of their group, that group has hurt people.</li><li>Premise F:\u00a0If a group has hurt people, then their symbols should be blamed and banned.</li><li>Conclusion: All mosques should be closed, all Muslim symbols should be banned, and all Muslims should be deported.</li></ul><p>This argument just doesn't work, for any number of reasons. First, the conclusion in no way follows from the premises. If all he wanted to do was ban Muslim symbols, then at least the conclusion makes sense from that standpoint, but he in no way introduces the idea of deportations and closing of mosques into the premises.</p><p>More importantly, the premises also just aren't true. In order to have a sound argument, you need to have true premises that logically lead to a true conclusion, which is a bar Alex has failed to reach.</p><p>All white people weren't blamed for Charleston, what happened was that many took it as an opportunity to examine the devastating effect the history of white supremacy has had in this country, and how that mentality has not disappeared at all. It was an opportunity to reflect on how differently people of different races experience day to day life, and wrestle with the fact that, as white people, we possess a lot of advantages that we have not earned, and those advantages have roots in our country's white supremacist history. This is not the same as blaming all white people for the actions of Dylann Roof, so Premise C is out. It's also what's known as a composition fallacy.</p><p>Premise D is stupid, since it's just really extending the composition fallacy.</p><p>Just for fun, I'd like to point out that using his argument, it would follow that since listeners of his program have hurt people in the past, the InfoWars logo should be banned, and he (along with all his listeners) should be deported. You see, when you use a composition fallacy, you open up the door for it to be used against you. It's a filthy business, this logic.</p><p>I choose not to even engage with Premise F, and how reductive and offensive it is that Alex would imply that the Confederate flag is somehow important iconography for all white people.</p><p>It's all a mess, and yes, I did break down that argument just to prove to myself that studying logic in college wasn't a complete waste.</p><p>All that said, what makes the \"Shark Jump\" a complete embarrassment is that, as he prepares to reveal his bizarre, logically flawed proposal, he paves the way with a bunch of stories that he thinks are building up his argument, but in reality, he's just lying about all of them.</p><p>Now, let us walk through this \"Shark Jump\" piece by piece, taking a break to debunk his stories as they come up.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1500334224732_382351\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"69000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Part 1: Brown Bags\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/596d7062b8a79be3e2da56e0/1500344420020/23-July17-SharkJump1-SeattleBansBrownBags.mp3/original/23-July17-SharkJump1-SeattleBansBrownBags.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1500334224732_382415\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>While Alex has a bit of a fair point that terror threats are used to peel back our civil liberties, that is the last thing I can agree with him about here. In the first leg of this trip, Alex builds up how important what he's about to say is, then insists that he's not using satire, which again I insist he is, just poorly.</p><p>He ends by claiming that \"brown bags are being banned in Seattle\" because they hurt some people's feelings. This is not true. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/theres-more-seattle-brown-bag-racial-controversy-meets-eye-f6C10836263\" target=\"_blank\">Here is the story he is basing that on</a>.</p><p>The term \"brown bag\" does have a racially loaded past, in that in the past, people's skin was compared to brown bags to see if they were light enough to be admitted into bars, social events, etc. The story that Alex is referring to is an in-office memo that someone wrote suggesting that people be conscious of this, and asking that people use comparable words that mean the same thing when discussing lunch meetings (sack lunch, for example), that wouldn't possibly make a coworker have to remember that term's history. It was not even a ban on the words, it was just a suggestion that people be considerate.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1500334224732_386823\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"19000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Part 2: Purple Penguins\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/596d70c3c534a53e65e4de40/1500344517873/24-July17-SharkJump2-PurplePenguins.mp3/original/24-July17-SharkJump2-PurplePenguins.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1500334224732_386888\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>In this next chunk, Alex lies about another story about someone suggesting that people be considerate.</p><p>He claims that \"nationwide\" children are being banned from using the words boy and girl, and that, in order to make sure no trans students feel hurt, everyone must be called \"purple penguins.\" This is an incredibly misleading version of the truth, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/education/purplepenguins.asp\" target=\"_blank\">which can be found here</a>.</p><p>Because Alex uses the term \"purple penguins,\" it is very easy to track this back to the original story. It is not something that is \"happening nationwide,\" and once again, no one is banning anything. What is actually happening is that a group called Gender Spectrum offered guidance to a school district in Nebraska about ways to make sure that all students are made to feel included in their classrooms.</p><p>The guidance included suggestions that mainly had to do with not gendering things that did not really need to include genders. For instance, if you are having children line up, don't separate them as boys and girls, but instead have them split up based on whether they like dogs or cats, or prefer reading or drawing. It is not a way of erasing gender, just a way of trying to not use gender as a dividing binary when it doesn't need to be.</p><p>The advice goes on to suggest that when a teacher is trying to get a group of children's attention, saying \"listen boys and girls\" is just injecting gender binaries where they don't need to be as well, and could make children outside the gender binary feel excluded.

    "citations_mediawiki": "The world on July 17, 2015:\r\n\r\n* Coming Soon\r\n\r\nWhat Alex covered on July 15th:\r\n\r\nThis episode is so insane, that I cannot cover it in bullet points. It is perhaps the weirdest thing that I have ever experienced watching months and months of The Alex Jones Show, and even now as I type this out, I find it mystifying. July 17th...The Day Alex Jones Intentionally Jumped The Shark\r\n\r\nI know exactly what Alex was trying to do in this episode. It's pretty clear that what he wants to do is cast himself as Jonathan Swift as he makes his very own Modest Proposal, but Alex does not realize that he is not making a logical point at all. He thinks he's making a shocking statement that's backed up by logic, but in reality, he's just exposing his own poor grasp on reality and his extreme hatred of Muslims.\r\n\r\nIn his essay, Swift used the suggestion of the poor selling their babies to be eaten by the rich as a way to highlight and mock how horribly the rich treated the poor already. It is an exaggeration made by heightening an already existing problem.\r\n\r\nConversely, Alex Jones' &quot;modest shark jump&quot; is him calling for the deportation of every Muslim, the banning of all mosques, and all Muslim symbols, ostensibly using the logic that &quot;some people want to ban the Confederate flag, so why not ban all Muslim things?&quot;\r\n\r\nHere, he falls into a number of logical traps. I will list them out for you:\r\n\r\n# In order for this to be satire (he claims that he is not being satirical, he is just using logic, but I disagree), he would need to be satirically advocating a position that he does not already tacitly support. He has many times in the past expressed deeply held feelings of distrust toward the Muslim community, and has often conflated radical terrorists with the general Muslim population. This is not an instance of him making a headline-grabbing statement to point out a social problem, it's him reaching the logical conclusion of his beliefs. He wants to outlaw Islam, and is using this weak argument as a shield to give him cover to express that.\r\n# If he wants to use this &quot;Shark Jump&quot; to start a conversation, it's a flawed premise. He acts like people want to ban the Confederate flag, therefore it makes sense for him to call for other iconography to be banned. But, the reality is that people were calling for Confederate flags to be taken down from government buildings, so the only real outcome that can come from this conversation is the conclusion that Islamic flags should also not be flown at government buildings, which I think most people already agree on.\r\n# Even if people were calling for the banning of the Confederate flag, which they were not, it still doesn't logically track for that to be analogous to banning Islamic iconography. In order for them to be equivalent, Alex would need to first make the argument that the Confederate flag was a religious symbol, and the Confederacy a religion, thereby making them logically relatable. I grant, flying a Confederate flag on your property is protected as free speech, but the argument of &quot;they want to ban A, so I suggest we ban B too&quot; doesn't work under these conditions. Also, people weren't trying to ban the Confederate flag.\r\n# But, Alex is not just calling for the banning of Islamic iconography. In his thought experiment, he is proposing essentially outlawing a religion, which he sees as being analogous to banning a Confederate flag. Just taken in terms of scale, this is pretty unfair as far as comparisons go.\r\n# He tries to use logic to make his argument, but he clearly has no experience in using actual logic. If you don't look at what he's saying, and you're already a bigot, his words may make sense to you. The problem is, the argument he's making is substantially more complicated than he thinks it is, as I attempt to lay out below:\r\n\r\n* Premise A: Terrorism being carried out by Muslims hurts people (&quot;A Muslim has hurt someone&quot;)\r\n* Premise B: The Charleston shooting carried out by a white person hurt people (&quot;A white person has hurt someone&quot;)\r\n* Premise C: All white people are blamed for the actions of one white person in the Charleston Shooting (&quot;If one white person has hurt someone, all white people are to blame&quot;)\r\n* Premise D: If all white people are blamed for the Charleston Shooting, then all Muslims should be blamed for things that any individual Muslim does.\u00a0\r\n* Premise E: If a group is blamed for the actions of an individual member of their group, that group has hurt people.\r\n* Premise F:\u00a0If a group has hurt people, then their symbols should be blamed and banned.\r\n* Conclusion: All mosques should be closed, all Muslim symbols should be banned, and all Muslims should be deported.\r\n\r\nThis argument just doesn't work, for any number of reasons. First, the conclusion in no way follows from the premises. If all he wanted to do was ban Muslim symbols, then at least the conclusion makes sense from that standpoint, but he in no way introduces the idea of deportations and closing of mosques into the premises.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the premises also just aren't true. In order to have a sound argument, you need to have true premises that logically lead to a true conclusion, which is a bar Alex has failed to reach.\r\n\r\nAll white people weren't blamed for Charleston, what happened was that many took it as an opportunity to examine the devastating effect the history of white supremacy has had in this country, and how that mentality has not disappeared at all. It was an opportunity to reflect on how differently people of different races experience day to day life, and wrestle with the fact that, as white people, we possess a lot of advantages that we have not earned, and those advantages have roots in our country's white supremacist history. This is not the same as blaming all white people for the actions of Dylann Roof, so Premise C is out. It's also what's known as a composition fallacy.\r\n\r\nPremise D is stupid, since it's just really extending the composition fallacy.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, I'd like to point out that using his argument, it would follow that since listeners of his program have hurt people in the past, the InfoWars logo should be banned, and he (along with all his listeners) should be deported. You see, when you use a composition fallacy, you open up the door for it to be used against you. It's a filthy business, this logic.\r\n\r\nI choose not to even engage with Premise F, and how reductive and offensive it is that Alex would imply that the Confederate flag is somehow important iconography for all white people.\r\n\r\nIt's all a mess, and yes, I did break down that argument just to prove to myself that studying logic in college wasn't a complete waste.\r\n\r\nAll that said, what makes the &quot;Shark Jump&quot; a complete embarrassment is that, as he prepares to reveal his bizarre, logically flawed proposal, he paves the way with a bunch of stories that he thinks are building up his argument, but in reality, he's just lying about all of them.\r\n\r\nNow, let us walk through this &quot;Shark Jump&quot; piece by piece, taking a break to debunk his stories as they come up.\r\n\r\nWhile Alex has a bit of a fair point that terror threats are used to peel back our civil liberties, that is the last thing I can agree with him about here. In the first leg of this trip, Alex builds up how important what he's about to say is, then insists that he's not using satire, which again I insist he is, just poorly.\r\n\r\nHe ends by claiming that &quot;brown bags are being banned in Seattle&quot; because they hurt some people's feelings. This is not true. [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/theres-more-seattle-brown-bag-racial-controversy-meets-eye-f6C10836263 Here is the story he is basing that on].\r\n\r\nThe term &quot;brown bag&quot; does have a racially loaded past, in that in the past, people's skin was compared to brown bags to see if they were light enough to be admitted into bars, social events, etc. The story that Alex is referring to is an in-office memo that someone wrote suggesting that people be conscious of this, and asking that people use comparable words that mean the same thing when discussing lunch meetings (sack lunch, for example), that wouldn't possibly make a coworker have to remember that term's history. It was not even a ban on the words, it was just a suggestion that people be considerate.\r\n\r\nIn this next chunk, Alex lies about another story about someone suggesting that people be considerate.\r\n\r\nHe claims that &quot;nationwide&quot; children are being banned from using the words boy and girl, and that, in order to make sure no trans students feel hurt, everyone must be called &quot;purple penguins.&quot; This is an incredibly misleading version of the truth, [http://www.snopes.com/politics/education/purplepenguins.asp which can be found here].\r\n\r\nBecause Alex uses the term &quot;purple penguins,&quot; it is very easy to track this back to the original story. It is not something that is &quot;happening nationwide,&quot; and once again, no one is banning anything. What is actually happening is that a group called Gender Spectrum offered guidance to a school district in Nebraska about ways to make sure that all students are made to feel included in their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe guidance included suggestions that mainly had to do with not gendering things that did not really need to include genders. For instance, if you are having children line up, don't separate them as boys and girls, but instead have them split up based on whether they like dogs or cats, or prefer reading or drawing. It is not a way of erasing gender, just a way of trying to not use gender as a dividing binary when it doesn't need to be.\r\n\r\nThe advice goes on to suggest that when a teacher is trying to get a group of children's attention, saying &quot;listen boys and girls&quot; is just injecting gender binaries where they don't need to be as well, and could make children outside the gender binary feel excluded. It is just as effective to give your classroom a team name, such as &quot;purple penguins&quot; (the throwaway example they used), and use that to get the kids' attention.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is not an instance of outlawing or banning language, it's just an advocacy group suggesting ways to slightly tweak ways things are expressed to make sure that all children are cared for and made to feel welcome. No one is erasing or banning gender. Just because Alex Jones thinks empathy is a Globalist plot, that does not mean it is.\r\n\r\nIn this clip, Alex makes his actual argument, that if people want to ban the Confederate flag, then Islam should be banned. This,\u00a0even as an intentional exaggeration, is absurd. We went over that already, so no need to dwell on it further here.\r\n\r\nHe punctuates his argument by claiming that police are showing up to flea markets to arrest people who are selling &quot;rebel flags.&quot; This is a complete lie. [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/flea-market-nazi-confederate-items-offends-customer-article-1.2290455 Here is the story that he is basing this on].

The vendor was not punished in any way.\r\n\r\nThe thing that Alex leaves out of the story, conveniently, is that the man who called the police did so because of the Nazi stuff, not the Confederate flag.

In order to beef up the story, Alex sends Joe Biggs down to an Austin-area Army recruitment center, where he and about 3 other people, stand guard with guns outside to protect the recruiters. No one attacks, and Alex loses interest in this narrative pretty quick.</li><li>Alex has fallen for more deceptively edited anti-Planned Parenthood videos put out by the Center For Medical Progress. This will come up pretty much every day for a while.</li><li>Alex admits that he has met the NY mafia.

What Really Happened was another conspiracy-oriented radio show that was broadcast by Genesis Communications Network until sometime in 2010, when he left the network, according to him because he and Alex Jones did not see eye to eye on Israel. Mike is staunchly anti-Israel, and felt that Alex was becoming more and more pro-Israel as time went on. His statement about moving his show off network included the following: \"GCN is a reflection of Alex Jones' views of the world, and more and more our points of view regarding Israel are diverging..I guess the breaking point was his rant in which he said that anyone who is a critic of Israel is a \"weak-minded fool.\"</li><li><strong>Walter Wagner</strong>: A retired nuclear safety officer who brought a lawsuit attempting to stop the creation of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Wagner was convinced that the risk was too high that their experiments could create a black hole and lead to the end of the planet. In September of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/09/29/doomsday-machine-lawsuit-tossed-out-by-judge.html\" target=\"_blank\">his suit was dismissed</a>.

He spends a lot of the time on the show putting this fear into eloquent language, explaining to his audience that if it happens, you won't even feel a thing, everything will just be gone. He does not discuss how most scientists believed the collider would be safe to operate.</p><p>The other main narrative Alex is on is about how Attorney General Michael Mukasey gave a speech at the Commonwealth Club defending George W.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\u00a0\r\n\r\n* '''Mike Rivero''': Host of What Really Happened with Mike Rivero. What Really Happened was another conspiracy-oriented radio show that was broadcast by Genesis Communications Network until sometime in 2010, when he left the network, according to him because he and Alex Jones did not see eye to eye on Israel. Mike is staunchly anti-Israel, and felt that Alex was becoming more and more pro-Israel as time went on. His statement about moving his show off network included the following: &quot;GCN is a reflection of Alex Jones' views of the world, and more and more our points of view regarding Israel are diverging..I guess the breaking point was his rant in which he said that anyone who is a critic of Israel is a &quot;weak-minded fool.&quot;\r\n* '''Walter Wagner''': A retired nuclear safety officer who brought a lawsuit attempting to stop the creation of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Wagner was convinced that the risk was too high that their experiments could create a black hole and lead to the end of the planet. In September of 2008, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/09/29/doomsday-machine-lawsuit-tossed-out-by-judge.html his suit was dismissed]. In August of 2010, [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2010/08/27/judge-man-cant-sue-over-lhcs-potential-destruction-of-the-earth/#.WqVpd66nHIU his appeal was thrown out of court], citing that Wagner had failed to show &quot;credible threat of harm,&quot; and noting that the US and its courts do not have jurisdiction over a European science facility.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nMost of this episode is about how afraid Alex is about the Large Hadron Collider, and how he is sure that it has a good chance of creating a black hole that will swallow up the planet and destroy all life instantly. He spends a lot of the time on the show putting this fear into eloquent language, explaining to his audience that if it happens, you won't even feel a thing, everything will just be gone. He does not discuss how most scientists believed the collider would be safe to operate.\r\n\r\nThe other main narrative Alex is on is about how Attorney General Michael Mukasey gave a speech at the Commonwealth Club defending George W. Bush's call for warrentless collection of phone calls that come from outside the country into the county, particularly from countries that are deemed to be involved in terrorism. Mukasey's argument is awful, and the programs he is discussing are terrible, but Alex's take on it is that in the speech, Mukasey more or less admitted that the government was complicit in perpetrating the attacks of 9/11. From [https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Mukasey-backs-Bush-efforts-on-wiretapping-3222161.php the only citation InfoWars provides] to back this up, it is a very large leap to make that interpretation.\r\n",

Tommy Robinson, whose real name appears to be Stephen Lennon, is on the show in an attempt to save face because a video came out over the weekend of him getting punched in the face in a McDonalds parking lot. The interview is largely about how he actually was the victim of a coordinated attack (by Antifa?) and that he actually won the fight. It's a fascinating mix of Tommy trying to preserve his masculinity, while at the same time, trying to firmly establish his claim to being a victim. Basically, he's right on the InfoWars wavelength.</li><li><strong>Mike Adams</strong>: \"The Health Ranger\" and proprietor of Natural News, one of the world's most popular \"health conspiracy\" websites. Most of his interview has to do with how his YouTube channel got taken down recently. It's really a meaningless interview, since YouTube is well within their rights to do that, so I don't really care. Mike is starting a new video hosting website, I think. I wish him the best of luck with that endeavor.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Narratives</strong></em>:</p><p>A large portion of today's show involves Alex going on unhinged rants about how the enemies he imagines he is up against are literally Satanic, and they want to kill your children.

    "citations_mediawiki": "Finally, Alex is back from &quot;vacation,&quot; and he comes out of the box hot.\r\n\r\n'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* '''Tommy Robinson''': Noted anti-Muslim agitator, and career criminal ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130313170714/http://news.sky.com/story/1034468/edl-leader-lennon-jailed-for-passport-offence convicted for having a fake passport in 2012], [http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-25110639 sentenced to 18 months in prison for mortgage fraud in 2014], to name a few crimes). Tommy Robinson, whose real name appears to be Stephen Lennon, is on the show in an attempt to save face because a video came out over the weekend of him getting punched in the face in a McDonalds parking lot. The interview is largely about how he actually was the victim of a coordinated attack (by Antifa?) and that he actually won the fight. It's a fascinating mix of Tommy trying to preserve his masculinity, while at the same time, trying to firmly establish his claim to being a victim. Basically, he's right on the InfoWars wavelength.\r\n* '''Mike Adams''': &quot;The Health Ranger&quot; and proprietor of Natural News, one of the world's most popular &quot;health conspiracy&quot; websites. Most of his interview has to do with how his YouTube channel got taken down recently. It's really a meaningless interview, since YouTube is well within their rights to do that, so I don't really care. Mike is starting a new video hosting website, I think. I wish him the best of luck with that endeavor.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nA large portion of today's show involves Alex going on unhinged rants about how the enemies he imagines he is up against are literally Satanic, and they want to kill your children. He keeps telling a very clearly fictitious story from his &quot;vacation&quot; wherein he is verbally assaulted by two gay men at the airport who (he claims) are offended by the fact that he has a family. Conveniently, he didn't get any of this on tape, particularly the part where these men try to start a fight with Alex's 15 year old son.\r\n\r\nAlex's interview with Tommy Robinson takes up about an hour of the show, and is really just Tommy making sure everyone remembers that he's a big boy and good at fighting, interspersed with occasional yelling about Muslims. At one point, Alex says that Tommy is &quot;the greatest patriot&quot; alive today, which should be a strong indication that when Alex talks about &quot;patriotism,&quot; he's not talking about a connection to one's country,. He probably uses the term to mean more of an ethnicity-based allegiance that he feels. This is incredibly troubling.\r\n\r\nAlex has some interesting ideas about history on this episode, and he says a few things I have not heard him say before. For instance, he says that the original &quot;Globalist traitor&quot; was Harry S. Truman and that Alex wishes that General McArthur had carried out a military coup back then. This is nuts to hear someone who is supposedly for democratic government say, as generally speaking, military coups rarely lead to stability and acquiescence of power.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, however, that neo-Nazis are really not into President Truman, and may think of him as a traitor as well (a &quot;race traitor&quot;), because he ended WW2, which led to the collapse of the Third Reich, and the creation of the state of Israel.

As if that weren't bad enough, Alex turns it into an advertisement for Super Male Vitality and some of his other products, as he uses them as condiments and dresses his burger with way more than the daily recommended dose of his supplements.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty gross, it's incredibly embarrassing, but it's also pretty funny when you consider that Alex Jones is a man who wants to be taken seriously, yet does this on air after talking to his &quot;news director&quot; about how his wife felt about him getting more boners while taking the products they sell.\r\n",

It is disgraceful, and should tell you everything you need to know about Alex's integrity.\r\n\r\nPast this, Alex spends a lot of time trying to tie the idea of abortion to black genocide, and gets very weird about the fact that he has admitted on air that he's paid for multiple abortions in the past.\r\n\r\nAs for the 2016 election, here is Alex's position as of August 13th:\r\n\r\n* Alex has an African-American guest, so he says &quot;Ben Carson would be a real black president&quot;\r\n* Alex says that maybe Trump could save the world, but he's been in with the &quot;Globalists&quot; for his whole life, and says that he &quot;smells a big rat.&quot;\r\n* Alex still supports Rand Paul for President, but would be fine if Carson won.\r\n\r\nBeyond all that, Alex asserts that &quot;Russia hasn't done anything to anyone&quot; as it relates to Ukraine (Alex says it's all George Soros' fault), and Alex claims that NAMBLA is a federally recognized non-profit (it is not, in fact there are strong indications that NAMBLA doesn't even really exist anymore as a centralized organization).\r\n",

He spends almost the whole first hour complaining about fake versions of the lawsuits against him, and telling his audience that they need to give him money.</p><p>He takes the narrative up to a whole new level today, going so far as to say that if the people suing him are successful, it will be the end of the 1st amendment.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1521063409655_15411\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"March 14, 2015\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"31000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"If Alex Goes Down, So Does Free Speech\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5aa9965f0d9297e80c7ecc20/1521063519876/CasesWillUndoTheFirstAmendment.mp3/original/CasesWillUndoTheFirstAmendment.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1521063409655_15478\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>Ignore for a minute that the result of a civil trial can in no way set a precedent that would undo an amendment to the constitution. Ignore for a second that the only way to repeal an amendment to the constitution is to pass a new amendment to the constitution, which would require support of 2/3 of the members of Congress, and then need to be voted in by 3/4 of the states. Ignore for a moment that if this ruling of the judge in Alex's civil trial did conflict with the 1st amendment, all he would need to do would be to appeal the ruling and demonstrate that his rights were violated. Ignore for a little bit that the 1st amendment covers substantially more than \"free speech,\" and in no way could this case do anything to any of that.\u00a0Please keep ignoring these very basic truths, it's much more fun to just hear Alex yell.</p><p>In reality, he has been skating by narrowly avoiding libel and slander suits for his entire career, and this is the end result, the chickens coming home to roost. Ultimately, he's begging the audience for money because he knows he's going to settle all of these lawsuits out of court and take a big hit, rather than risk what could come out if he had to defend any of his positions under oath. It's a pathetic display, and we can expect a whole lot more of it in the days to come.</p><p>In another interesting development, Alex Jones is now seemingly trying to get himself involved in lawsuits that aren't being brought against him. <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/seth-rich-parents-lawsuit-fox-news/\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Rich's parents have filed a suit</a> against Fox News, Malia Zimmerman, and Ed Butowsky for creating and pushing a false story about their son's death that has caused them considerable harm. Due to the contents of emails that have come out from Butowsky showing a clear conspiracy to push the story in an effort to clear the Russians of the accusation of hacking DNC servers,\u00a0it will probably be a successful suit.</p><p>Alex is pretending that the Rich's lawsuit is just them suing Fox News for \"investigating\" their son's murder. He is trying to pitch the narrative that people like Sean Hannity care more about finding the truth about Seth's murder than his parents do, which is a line so disgusting it is hard to find a suitable thing to compare it to.</p><p>Alex spends a bit of the show talking about how Seth Rich was murdered, and was behind the DNC hacks, because he knows that the material claim of this lawsuit is not about people spreading lies about Seth Rich; it is about the very clear conspiracy behind the scenes at Fox News to use his tragic death as a prop to defend Trump and Russia.</p><p>Other than that, the only part of the show that merits further mention is how awful and not funny Gavin McInness is. He has about a half-hour segment, and he spends most of the beginning of it accusing George Soros of having led Nazis to Jews, leading to their \"extermination.\"</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1521063409655_33657\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"March 14, 2018\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"21000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Gavin Lies About George Soros\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5aa99b410d9297e80c7fd56f/1521064770571/GavinSorosLie.mp3/original/GavinSorosLie.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1521063409655_33723\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>I've already <a href=\"https://knowledgefight.com/lie-files/2017/3/18/george-soros-helped-the-nazis-round-up-jews-in-the-holocaust\" target=\"_blank\">written about this lie in detail here</a>, so I won't bore the reader again.

He claims it came directly from law enforcement that the bombs are amateur in nature, and may not look like a normal package. These are things that anyone could probably deduce. The part that is interesting about Alex's claim, however, is that he says that his source told him that the bombs are made on the doorstep where they are left, which seems like a completely inefficient plan for a bomber to utilize as it would leave them pretty exposed while they were assembling the bomb.

Then, he and Alex spout a bunch of dumb theories about lesbians and about how liberals just want to be mad at &quot;daddy,&quot; who I guess is supposed to be represented by these two assholes.\r\n* '''Steve Pieczenik''': It appears that Steve is on the show today to make sure that Alex does not get suspicious about the CIA Director being made the new Secretary of State. Alex does constantly accuse the CIA of being part of the Deep State, so there would be cause for concern that he might look at this as a coup. Steve is a fan of Mike Pompeo (who is also a Koch favorite), and wants to make sure that Alex doesn't start pushing back against him. Also, he repeatedly calls George Soros a &quot;Jew rat.&quot;\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nAs has been the theme lately, most of this show is about how Alex is the victim of a coordinated attack, carried out by (if you believe Alex's version) the Pope, the Jesuits, Georgetown University, George Soros, the &quot;Globalists,&quot; the Deep State, Hillary's former top lawyer, Michael Jackson's lawyer, and the entirety of the Democratic party. He spends almost the whole first hour complaining about fake versions of the lawsuits against him, and telling his audience that they need to give him money.\r\n\r\nHe takes the narrative up to a whole new level today, going so far as to say that if the people suing him are successful, it will be the end of the 1st amendment.\r\n\r\nIgnore for a minute that the result of a civil trial can in no way set a precedent that would undo an amendment to the constitution. Ignore for a second that the only way to repeal an amendment to the constitution is to pass a new amendment to the constitution, which would require support of 2/3 of the members of Congress, and then need to be voted in by 3/4 of the states. Ignore for a moment that if this ruling of the judge in Alex's civil trial did conflict with the 1st amendment, all he would need to do would be to appeal the ruling and demonstrate that his rights were violated. Ignore for a little bit that the 1st amendment covers substantially more than &quot;free speech,&quot; and in no way could this case do anything to any of that.\u00a0Please keep ignoring these very basic truths, it's much more fun to just hear Alex yell.\r\n\r\nIn reality, he has been skating by narrowly avoiding libel and slander suits for his entire career, and this is the end result, the chickens coming home to roost. Ultimately, he's begging the audience for money because he knows he's going to settle all of these lawsuits out of court and take a big hit, rather than risk what could come out if he had to defend any of his positions under oath. It's a pathetic display, and we can expect a whole lot more of it in the days to come.\r\n\r\nIn another interesting development, Alex Jones is now seemingly trying to get himself involved in lawsuits that aren't being brought against him. [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/seth-rich-parents-lawsuit-fox-news/ Seth Rich's parents have filed a suit] against Fox News, Malia Zimmerman, and Ed Butowsky for creating and pushing a false story about their son's death that has caused them considerable harm. Due to the contents of emails that have come out from Butowsky showing a clear conspiracy to push the story in an effort to clear the Russians of the accusation of hacking DNC servers,\u00a0it will probably be a successful suit.\r\n\r\nAlex is pretending that the Rich's lawsuit is just them suing Fox News for &quot;investigating&quot; their son's murder. He is trying to pitch the narrative that people like Sean Hannity care more about finding the truth about Seth's murder than his parents do, which is a line so disgusting it is hard to find a suitable thing to compare it to.\r\n\r\nAlex spends a bit of the show talking about how Seth Rich was murdered, and was behind the DNC hacks, because he knows that the material claim of this lawsuit is not about people spreading lies about Seth Rich; it is about the very clear conspiracy behind the scenes at Fox News to use his tragic death as a prop to defend Trump and Russia.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the only part of the show that merits further mention is how awful and not funny Gavin McInness is. He has about a half-hour segment, and he spends most of the beginning of it accusing George Soros of having led Nazis to Jews, leading to their &quot;extermination.&quot;\r\n\r\nI've already [https://knowledgefight.com/lie-files/2017/3/18/george-soros-helped-the-nazis-round-up-jews-in-the-holocaust written about this lie in detail here], so I won't bore the reader again. In reality, Gavin isn't upset about Soros, he's only bringing this up because he is all triggered about a lot of people calling his Nazi friends Nazis, all the while, it seems like only his Nazi friends are the ones calling George Soros a Nazi. It just doesn't make sense!\r\n\r\nGavin goes on to explain a very interesting theory about lesbians:\r\n\r\nHe seems to be operating under a couple of really fucked up assumptions:\r\n\r\n* Only gay people give birth to gay children\r\n* This is the first generation where lesbians have existed, and since they are not reproducing, there will be none next generation\r\n* A person's value to society is largely based on their reproductive ability\r\n\r\nHe believes the first two because he's a homophobic idiot and because he probably thinks he's being funny. He believes that third one because he is mad at white people who do not breed, as he thinks that other cultures are going to &quot;breed white people out of existence.&quot; These are your standard white genocide narratives, and they're not made any more convincing when you just swap out the word &quot;white&quot; with &quot;Western.&quot;\r\n\r\nAlex and Gavin go on to do some hacky two-man stand up routine, tossing around stupid stereotypes about gay men and lesbians:\r\n\r\nAs fun as it would be to go through this point by point, it's clear that Gavin presents himself as both a comedian and as a political commentator because he is terrible at both things. However, by pretending to be both, when a joke doesn't land, he can claim he was making a serious point. Conversely, when someone calls him out for being a complete idiot and a bigot, he can go the Coward's Route and claim he was just joking, and that you're so triggered that you don't get his humor. It's a pathetic game his community plays to dodge any responsibility for the things they say, or how unfunny they are.\r\n\r\nOn this show, Alex also claims to have received inside information about the bombings in Austin. He claims it came directly from law enforcement that the bombs are amateur in nature, and may not look like a normal package. These are things that anyone could probably deduce. The part that is interesting about Alex's claim, however, is that he says that his source told him that the bombs are made on the doorstep where they are left, which seems like a completely inefficient plan for a bomber to utilize as it would leave them pretty exposed while they were assembling the bomb. Seems very dumb.\u00a0When the facts of the case come out, we will see, but in the meantime, I will register that this does not sound real to me.\r\n",

The issue is that in the UK, \"the first amendment\" as we understand it does not exist, and if you say things that are intentionally inflammatory, you can be held accountable for the results of your actions, so Alex and Mark do not really have a leg to stand on. Mark's defense hinged on his insistence that he had trained his dog to do this, and made the video, to annoy his girlfriend, but that sort of implies that his girlfriend (or Mark himself) says \"Sieg Heil\" or \"gas the Jews\" enough that she would even notice. If neither of them ever said shit like that, there's no real payoff to this as a prank. Oh, also, Mark is on the show along with noted career criminal/con man/anti-Muslim agitator Tommy Robinson, so his credibility as a \"not racist person\" is in the toilet.</li><li><strong>Alexander Nekrassov</strong>: Nekrassov is a former (?) Kremlin presidential adviser, and has been involved with the Russian government for about the last two decades. He has a long history of writing for publications such as Al Jazeera and others about topics like how Marine Le Pen is great and it's not a problem that Russian state banks donated millions to her campaign, or how Putin is the good guy in Ukraine.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* '''Mark Meechan''': Meechan is an idiot from the UK who got in trouble because he posted a video of himself training his dog to give a Hitler Salute when he said &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; or &quot;gas the Jews.&quot; The same day he is appearing on InfoWars, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pug-nazi-salute-youtube-video-owner-guilty-hate-crime-mark-meechan-lanarkshire-a8265301.html he was found guilty in a Scottish court of having committed a hate crime]. The issue is that in the UK, &quot;the first amendment&quot; as we understand it does not exist, and if you say things that are intentionally inflammatory, you can be held accountable for the results of your actions, so Alex and Mark do not really have a leg to stand on. Mark's defense hinged on his insistence that he had trained his dog to do this, and made the video, to annoy his girlfriend, but that sort of implies that his girlfriend (or Mark himself) says &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; or &quot;gas the Jews&quot; enough that she would even notice. If neither of them ever said shit like that, there's no real payoff to this as a prank. Oh, also, Mark is on the show along with noted career criminal/con man/anti-Muslim agitator Tommy Robinson, so his credibility as a &quot;not racist person&quot; is in the toilet.\r\n* '''Alexander Nekrassov''': Nekrassov is a former (?) Kremlin presidential adviser, and has been involved with the Russian government for about the last two decades. He has a long history of writing for publications such as Al Jazeera and others about topics like how Marine Le Pen is great and it's not a problem that Russian state banks donated millions to her campaign, or how Putin is the good guy in Ukraine. He seems to have a pretty consistent messaging with state media outlets. In his interview, he literally tells Alex that when he worked for the Kremlin, he was a &quot;fixer,&quot; and his job would be to work behind the scenes. Alex does not grasp that he is being worked over by a high-level foreign government fixer live on air at any point.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nThe first half-hour of the show today seems to have one goal in mind: sow doubt about the stories that are coming out about Cambridge Analytica, the data company run by Trump's former campaign manager Steve Bannon, and funded by billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer.\r\n\r\nIn the days previous to March 20, Channel 4 in the UK started revealing the results of a four month investigation into Cambridge Analytica, which included undercover recordings of their CEO Alexander Nix ([http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-cambridge-analytica-suspends-ceo-20180320-story.html who has now been suspended pending an investigation]) admitting that their techniques of getting people elected to lead countries all over the world often involved blackmail and dissemination of propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe investigation is very illuminating and calls into very serious question how badly fooled Alex was by a propaganda marketing firm.

As this interview is happening, I checked and his YouTube channel is live, so I'm a little confused by their claims that it is not. Spike's Tactical is a sponsor of The Alex Jones Show, so this interview serves as a de facto commercial for them, as well as proof that Alex and everyone he associates with is under attack. Cope thinks that he is being singled out because <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/not-today-antifa-gun-company-offers-zero-apologies-threatening-communist-783542\" target=\"_blank\">he dared to \"stand up to Antifa\"</a> when he made an ad that many saw as being very literally threatening to shoot people he arbitrarily was labeling \"Antifa.\" Also on this episode, Cope expresses that he believes that major shootings are false flags, using crisis actors.</li><li><strong>Tim Harmsen</strong>: Tim is the runner of the YouTube channel Military Arms Channel. He is on to talk about how his YouTube channel was taken down, but early in the interview he makes abundantly clear that his channel is currently live. His main concern seems to be that YouTube's rules are too vague, and that may be the case. In this instance, however, they have been very clear about the new rules, and he runs afoul of them because he runs a gun store and uses the channel as advertising. His argument seems to boil down to \"it's legal for me to talk about guns,\" but that is pretty irrelevant to the matter at hand. YouTube is not arresting him. Tim also believes the Southern Poverty Law Center is a radical \"far left organization.\"</li><li><strong>Laura Loomer</strong>: Laura is a completely insane \"investigative journalist,\" but more importantly an aggressive Islamophobe. She has actively advocated for banning Islam because she fervently believes that <em>all</em> Muslims are the same and she hates/fears them all. She used to work for Project Veritas and Rebel Media, which makes her unemployable at any real journalistic outlet, so she is \"independent,\" and shows up on Alex's show from time to time, generally to bash Muslims or to claim that various acts of white terrorism were false flags. Laura seems to be in favor of political censorship of art, as she was behind the publicity stunt disruption of the June 2017 performance of Julius Caesar where Caesar was a Trump facsimile, being willingly obtuse that Shakespeare In The Park has done iterations of the show with Caesar being Obama and George W Bush in the past. She is so terrible that even most of the Alt-Right doesn't like her.</li><li><strong>Jon Rappoport</strong> hosted the 4th Hour, but Alex took up most of his time talking to Laura Loomer because he spent too much time talking to his gun buddies (sponsor) earlier in the show.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Narratives</strong></em>:</p><p>One of Alex's lead stories today is that YouTube is \"banning gun videos.\" This is a gross mischaracterization of the actual story.</p><p><a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpxyw/youtube-bans-diy-and-commercially-focused-gun-videos\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube announced that it would ban videos that directly sold guns</a>, or linked to direct gun sales. Further, they would not allow videos that demonstrate how to build gun modifications like silencers or high-capacity magazines, or even show how to install such things. Whatever your feelings are about this (we feel it makes some sense, but may be impossible to enforce), this is not \"banning gun videos.\" People can still post videos of recreational shooting, or gun reviews, they just can't do so if they are sponsored by direct gun sales.</p><p>In an interesting turn of events, German YouTube creator J\u00f6rg Sprave has created a novel solution to this. He runs a video channel where he creates elaborate and cool slingshots, and in order to fight back against what he sees as encroachment from YouTube, <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pam5mk/youtube-union-slingshot-channel-jorg-sprave\" target=\"_blank\">he has suggested that YouTube creators form a union</a>. Very interesting idea. Gonna guess Alex doesn't get behind that very reasonable and productive idea; he's probably just gonna yell a bunch and try to scare people into buying his pills, and his sponsor's guns.</p><p>Which brings me to the next important point:\u00a0one of the reasons that Alex is particularly interested in misrepresenting YouTube's actons is that one of his sponsors is being affected.</p><p>Alex runs ads for Spike's Tactical (he even airs one in the middle of his interview with Cope), a gun maker/seller based out of Florida, and <a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-gun-makers-banned-youtube-20180321-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">they have had their YouTube channel cracked down on</a>, because they sell guns directly (particularly AR-15s) and have videos demonstrating gun modifications (<a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-spikes-tactical-antifa-newsweek-20180110-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">they also made an ad</a>\u00a0recently where they kinda sorta threaten to shoot a bunch of \"antifa,\" which most thought was in incredibly poor taste).</p><p>I understand standing up for your sponsor, but this is such a stretch. The way he is creating a complete strawman of the ban just so he can protect Spike's Tactical, seems to be letting the content of the show be led by the sponsor, which is pretty much Alex's style (see: years of warnings of imminent collapse of the dollar, while Alex's primary sponsor was a gold sales company).</p><p>Alex's primary argument seems to be that, if conservatives get in trouble for not baking a cake for a gay couple, then YouTube can't in anyway police gun videos on their platform. This logic is profoundly flawed. For instance, people who like/sell guns are not a federally protected class, and the Civil Rights Act does not protect people who just like guns.</p><p>In the end, the only things they can come up with to resolve any of their perceived grievances\u00a0 go 100% against Alex's principles. The fact that they are advocating for regulations on a private business (YouTube) and forming a union to protect their rights as \"employees\" (or \"creators\")\u00a0just goes to show that, for Alex and his ilk, philosophies and belief go out the window when they feel threatened.</p><p>Also on this episode, Alex plays large segments of Donald Trump's speech announcing new tariffs on China because of their copyright infringement. This is very likely going to lead to a trade war that will hurt the American middle and lower classes very badly.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* '''Kit Cope''': Kit runs Spike's Tactical, a gun maker/seller from Florida that was recently cracked down upon by YouTube. As this interview is happening, I checked and his YouTube channel is live, so I'm a little confused by their claims that it is not. Spike's Tactical is a sponsor of The Alex Jones Show, so this interview serves as a de facto commercial for them, as well as proof that Alex and everyone he associates with is under attack. Cope thinks that he is being singled out because [http://www.newsweek.com/not-today-antifa-gun-company-offers-zero-apologies-threatening-communist-783542 he dared to &quot;stand up to Antifa&quot;] when he made an ad that many saw as being very literally threatening to shoot people he arbitrarily was labeling &quot;Antifa.&quot; Also on this episode, Cope expresses that he believes that major shootings are false flags, using crisis actors.\r\n* '''Tim Harmsen''': Tim is the runner of the YouTube channel Military Arms Channel. He is on to talk about how his YouTube channel was taken down, but early in the interview he makes abundantly clear that his channel is currently live. His main concern seems to be that YouTube's rules are too vague, and that may be the case. In this instance, however, they have been very clear about the new rules, and he runs afoul of them because he runs a gun store and uses the channel as advertising. His argument seems to boil down to &quot;it's legal for me to talk about guns,&quot; but that is pretty irrelevant to the matter at hand. YouTube is not arresting him. Tim also believes the Southern Poverty Law Center is a radical &quot;far left organization.&quot;\r\n* '''Laura Loomer''': Laura is a completely insane &quot;investigative journalist,&quot; but more importantly an aggressive Islamophobe. She has actively advocated for banning Islam because she fervently believes that ''all'' Muslims are the same and she hates/fears them all. She used to work for Project Veritas and Rebel Media, which makes her unemployable at any real journalistic outlet, so she is &quot;independent,&quot; and shows up on Alex's show from time to time, generally to bash Muslims or to claim that various acts of white terrorism were false flags. Laura seems to be in favor of political censorship of art, as she was behind the publicity stunt disruption of the June 2017 performance of Julius Caesar where Caesar was a Trump facsimile, being willingly obtuse that Shakespeare In The Park has done iterations of the show with Caesar being Obama and George W Bush in the past. She is so terrible that even most of the Alt-Right doesn't like her.\r\n* '''Jon Rappoport''' hosted the 4th Hour, but Alex took up most of his time talking to Laura Loomer because he spent too much time talking to his gun buddies (sponsor) earlier in the show.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nOne of Alex's lead stories today is that YouTube is &quot;banning gun videos.&quot; This is a gross mischaracterization of the actual story.\r\n\r\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpxyw/youtube-bans-diy-and-commercially-focused-gun-videos YouTube announced that it would ban videos that directly sold guns], or linked to direct gun sales. Further, they would not allow videos that demonstrate how to build gun modifications like silencers or high-capacity magazines, or even show how to install such things. Whatever your feelings are about this (we feel it makes some sense, but may be impossible to enforce), this is not &quot;banning gun videos.&quot; People can still post videos of recreational shooting, or gun reviews, they just can't do so if they are sponsored by direct gun sales.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting turn of events, German YouTube creator J\u00f6rg Sprave has created a novel solution to this. He runs a video channel where he creates elaborate and cool slingshots, and in order to fight back against what he sees as encroachment from YouTube, [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pam5mk/youtube-union-slingshot-channel-jorg-sprave he has suggested that YouTube creators form a union]. Very interesting idea. Gonna guess Alex doesn't get behind that very reasonable and productive idea; he's probably just gonna yell a bunch and try to scare people into buying his pills, and his sponsor's guns.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the next important point:\u00a0one of the reasons that Alex is particularly interested in misrepresenting YouTube's actons is that one of his sponsors is being affected.\r\n\r\nAlex runs ads for Spike's Tactical (he even airs one in the middle of his interview with Cope), a gun maker/seller based out of Florida, and [http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-gun-makers-banned-youtube-20180321-story.html they have had their YouTube channel cracked down on], because they sell guns directly (particularly AR-15s) and have videos demonstrating gun modifications ([http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-spikes-tactical-antifa-newsweek-20180110-story.html they also made an ad]\u00a0recently where they kinda sorta threaten to shoot a bunch of &quot;antifa,&quot; which most thought was in incredibly poor taste).\r\n\r\nI understand standing up for your sponsor, but this is such a stretch. The way he is creating a complete strawman of the ban just so he can protect Spike's Tactical, seems to be letting the content of the show be led by the sponsor, which is pretty much Alex's style (see: years of warnings of imminent collapse of the dollar, while Alex's primary sponsor was a gold sales company).\r\n\r\nAlex's primary argument seems to be that, if conservatives get in trouble for not baking a cake for a gay couple, then YouTube can't in anyway police gun videos on their platform. This logic is profoundly flawed. For instance, people who like/sell guns are not a federally protected class, and the Civil Rights Act does not protect people who just like guns.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the only things they can come up with to resolve any of their perceived grievances\u00a0 go 100% against Alex's principles. The fact that they are advocating for regulations on a private business (YouTube) and forming a union to protect their rights as &quot;employees&quot; (or &quot;creators&quot;)\u00a0just goes to show that, for Alex and his ilk, philosophies and belief go out the window when they feel threatened.\r\n\r\nAlso on this episode, Alex plays large segments of Donald Trump's speech announcing new tariffs on China because of their copyright infringement. This is very likely going to lead to a trade war that will hurt the American middle and lower classes very badly. Before Trump made his announcement, Chinese state newspaper [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-threatens-all-necessary-measures-if-trump-imposes-trade-tariffs-n858991 China Daily warned]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cHistory has shown the pinpricks of protectionism can ultimately lead to the shots of war somewhere down the line.\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nNot very subtle.\r\n\r\nThe timing for this is particularly bad, since Xi Jinping recently declared himself &quot;supreme leader for life,&quot; and as such cannot afford to show any weakness in the position, thus you can expect that he will respond harshly. Considering that China has a myriad of options at their disposal to hurt the US far more than these tariffs will hurt them (levying export taxes, increasing security inspections, delaying paperwork, messing with customs operations, etc.), and the fact that the US needs China's assistance to address the situation in North Korea peacefully, Trump's behavior is a very troubling development.\r\n\r\nMost likely, he is posturing to try to show strength in a negotiation that will end up leading us directly back to where we were before, with Trump &quot;virtue-signaling&quot; to his base that he is &quot;hard on China.&quot; Hopefully that's the case, because the other way this could go is a trade war in which the United States is woefully outgunned.\r\n\r\nLaura Loomer shows up toward the end of the show to talk about a new &quot;undercover sting&quot; she carried out at a meeting in preparation for the Parkland students who were going to the March For Our Lives. You can watch all of it if you have the patience for like five minutes of choppily edited audio, but based on my viewing of it, all she really captured on tape is a teacher admitting that they don't have a permit for a march, but instead for a rally, so after the rally, they may all leave the same direction. This happens at pretty much every rally ever.\r\n\r\nOn Alex's show, she makes some incredibly fucked up accusations that her video does not show. She says that the teacher, Debby Miller, tells the students in attendance that &quot;Jews run politicians.&quot; This is complete bullshit.\r\n\r\nDebby Miller is discussing how it is not going to be raining on Saturday, the day of the rally, at which point, she makes the following joke:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cI would say something about the politician who said the Jews were in control of weather, so come on.\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nThe joke lacks a punchline, certainly, but she is clearly referencing the DC Council Member, Trayon White, [https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/19/17139516/dc-lawmaker-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theory-trayon-white who last week said]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cIt just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man.

His position was that there weren't enough countries on the &quot;Axis Of Evil,&quot; and that we should aim to take out even more leaders.\r\n\r\nSince then, Bolton has been very active pushing for a war with Iran, [https://theintercept.com/2018/03/23/heres-john-bolton-promising-regime-change-iran-end-2018/ going so far as to tell an Iranian exile group] (who is very unpopular in Iran) that there would be regime change in Iran by the end of 2018. He told them that eight months ago. He is the literal definition of a war-monger, and as Alex tries to pretend that he is against &quot;nation building&quot; and is for everyone having &quot;national sovereignty,&quot; Alex should be very, very against Bolton being anywhere near power.\r\n\r\nBut, because Alex is an idiot, he believes that John Bolton is just going to come in and be a strong force to push &quot;Trump's agenda.&quot; His only reason for believing this, of course, is that Roger Stone told him so. This should be an indication that Alex is past the point of no return; if he can accept the idea of John Bolton being in the administration, there is nothing that can shake him.\r\n\r\nTo give the appearance of &quot;looking at both sides,&quot; Alex has Dr. Francis Boyle on to say some negative stuff about Bolton. Alex doesn't engage about any of it, doubles-down on his position that Roger has fed him, and tries to steer the interview into being about something he and Boyle agree on, namely that Hillary Clinton sucks. It's a sad attempt at looking like he's covering the issues from all sides.\r\n\r\nDuring the broadcast, Trump holds a press conference where he discusses and signs the Omnibus Spending Bill. Before he signs the bill, Alex is absolutely convinced that he is going to veto it, to the point where Alex interrupts the video multiple times to say stuff like &quot;HE'S GONNA SHUT IT DOWN!&quot;\r\n\r\nAs soon as Trump signs the bill, Alex immediately starts equivocating, explaining that Trump has to keep the government going. It's a very sad turnaround to witness, especially after Alex plays the audio on the show of Trump explaining that an important consideration for signing the bill is to allow arms sales to Saudi Arabia to proceed. Again, that is arms sales to Saudi Arabia, something that Alex likes to pretend he's against.\r\n\r\nLater, Alex spends more of the show than he needs to to complain that Parkland survivor David Hogg is bullying him. It's your run-of-the-mill Alex self-victimization narrative, where he misinterprets complaints that people are making about him and just responds to the fake version as opposed to the real one.\r\n\r\nAlex takes particular issue with the fact that David Hogg made fun of Alex's &quot;gay frogs&quot; comments in a C-SPAN appearance, because Alex believes that science backs up his claims. Unfortunately, this is not the case.\r\n\r\nAlex keeps flashing up one article, a &quot;[http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/ Berkeley study],&quot; that he seems to think is enough to justify his claims that things in the water are turning frogs gay and that it will do the same to humans. The problem, as is so often the case, is that Alex did not do enough reading.\r\n\r\nWhat that article claims is that the chemical atrazine appears to be capable of inducing a change of sex in frogs that are exposed to elevated levels of it in their environment, but the issue with that is that some [https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/vbgvw4/a-quick-refresher-the-truth-about-water-making-you-gay fish and amphibians are able to spontaneously change sex], and the prevailing thought is that atrazine may trigger this mechanism, which does not exist in humans.\r\n\r\nThere is no implication for people, and studies that have shown affects on humans (such as aggravating cancers, for instance) have been redacted by the people who ran the studies over concerns that they did not properly carry the study out.\r\n\r\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230407/ Studies that have not been retracted] have shown &quot;there was no consistent evidence of an association between atrazine use and any cancer site.&quot; Or, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5072122/ others that have not been retracted] have concluded &quot;atrazine levels were not associated with ovarian cancer risk.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe way people are exposed to atrazine is almost exclusively as farmers who use it as an herbicide. Studies have shown an increase in premature births with farmers who use atrazine, but the results were deemed inconclusive because the farmers were exposed to many different chemicals, and the study could not pinpoint which might associated with the premature deliveries.\r\n\r\nThe only other ways that people get exposed are through some seepage into the ground water in communities very near farms that use atrazine, but studies have not shown this to be a very serious risk to human health.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons for why there are affects on frogs, but not on humans (beyond the very obvious and substantive biological differences), is that frogs live in water and breath water through gills. They are completely immersed in the water, and thus, if the water has a particular chemical in it, they are obviously going to be more affected by it.\r\n\r\nAll this is to say that David Hogg is absolutely right to mock Alex Jones for his stupidity, and Alex is such a soft boy for getting on his radio show to complain that a high schooler is &quot;bullying him.&quot;\r\n",

I won't hold my breath.\r\n\r\nIn terms of fun stuff that happens on the show, we get a nice instance of Alex telling a clearly fake story about getting mobbed by a very ethnically diverse crowd of fans at Six Flags:\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat in service of a narrative that he's been pushing for a long time: that the youth, Generation Z, is mostly Libertarian Conservatives, and that the tide is turning. You see him telling these stories about being a rock star at his kids' soccer games and shit, and obviously it is him telling exaggerated stories that stroke his grandiose ego, but at one point on this show, he says that studies show that Gen Z is all like him:\r\n\r\nAlex says &quot;studies,&quot; but what he's actually talking about is one &quot;study&quot; carried out by a British marketing company called The Gild. Their results are the source that is universally cited in articles that discuss the coming generation's shift toward conservatism.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that The Gild's &quot;study&quot; is wildly unscientific. It is basically just a browser quiz with no procedural controls or methodology. It is the political orientation equivalent of a &quot;Which Member of NSYNC Are You?&quot; quiz you may have taken on Buzzfeed years ago.\r\n\r\nThis study should absolutely be discounted, as it doesn't meet the standards of what qualifies as a representative sampled study. For a more in-depth look at this study, [http://afterthemillennials.com/why-generation-z-is-not-more-conservative/ you can click here].\r\n\r\nAfter the first hour, Alex leaves Owen to host, so what's the point in listening to that?\r\n",

Marc was also involved in the deceitful propaganda campaign against John Kerry known as the Swiftboating, where conservative liars spread lies about Kerry's military service in hopes of swaying the 2004 election.

It is one of the most disgraceful, embarrassing, and horrifying things I've ever seen in my life. The way Rex was talking bordered on an Alex Jones impression, and he was using many of Alex's catchphrases. It was very clear that either Alex coached him, or worse, he doesn't realize that he is emulating a horrible role-model. We still believe criticism of Rex himself is off-limits, as he is a child and he is being exploited, but I bring this up because of how poorly it reflects on Alex.</li><li>Alex spends a large chunk of this show screaming about how Muslims want to have sex with children, not realizing that two of his guests on <em>this very day's show</em>, Tommy Robinson and Ted Nugent, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120530013851/http://www.loonwatch.com/2012/05/edl-leader-tommy-robinson-outed-as-child-sex-pest/\" target=\"_blank\">have sexually harassed underage girls on Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html\" target=\"_blank\">adopted a 17 year old when he was 30 so he could have sex with her without her parents protesting</a>\u00a0(and may have done way worse stuff too). Alex is a complete idiot.</li><li>Alex calls for the indictment of Robert Mueller, screaming vague accusations about him being \"on tarmacs.\" This is a reference to how Mueller delivered a sample of uranium that was confiscated from criminals to Russian authorities as part of a joint investigation. It was entirely above board, but Alex uses it because he is really scared about the stories that are coming out that notorious fraud-committer Ted Malloch may be in Mueller's cross hairs. And Alex should be concerned. Malloch was very involved in the Brexit campaign, and he was a behind-the-scenes adviser for the Trump campaign, the common thread between those things being Cambridge Analytica. If Mueller is speaking to Malloch, that is a pretty obvious sign that they have some information that his role in those two campaigns may have been connected.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Beyond those main points that are pretty interesting, there are a few stray things Alex says here and there that seem very weird, but also seem kind of like him speaking extemporaneously. For instance, he says that he likes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. That seems strange, but since he doesn't really get into it, I'll wait until he elaborates to judge what he's talking about.</p><p>Also, Alex goes on a collaborative rant with Tommy Robinson about how the Russians did not try to kill Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The rest of the world is pretty much in consensus that they did, but I guess Alex has better information. He's usually right about everything.</p><p>The two of them scream about how \"they\" aren't even telling people if the ex-spy and his daughter are alive, which is weird because that is a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/29/597937016/daughter-of-ex-russian-spy-improving-rapidly-u-k-health-officials-say\" target=\"_blank\">very easy piece of information to find</a>.\u00a0</p><p>My favorite part of the rant is when Alex posits that if Russia was behind the attempted murder, they wouldn't have used a nerve agent, because smart assassins use \"a bag.\" Alright, Alex.</p><p>Doug Hagman hosted the 4th Hour of the show, and I only watched a little bit of it because he's very boring, but thankfully I didn't turn it right off. In the beginning of their interview, Alex reveals that he definitely believes that the \"Globalists\" drink children's blood and that they need to scare them to produce adrenochrome.\u00a0</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1522257402458_475315\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"March 29, 2018\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"40000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Elites Drink Children's Blood\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5abd52892b6a2842626e8808/1522356874817/Adrenochrome.mp3/original/Adrenochrome.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1522257402458_475381\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>This man loves to pretend he's just talking metaphorically when he calls people vampires, because he knows that when he makes the accusations literal, as he does here, it's really easy to see how most of his beliefs about the \"Globalists\" are just slight variations on generations old Blood Libel and other antisemitic propaganda.</p>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>",

He has a career long track record of being a liar for hire, and thus, fits right in with Alex Jones.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nThis show is all over the place, hitting on a lot of Alex's favorite talking points: Islam is evil at its core, guns are the greatest thing in the world, and liberals are &quot;the enemy.&quot; Overall, it's a pretty boring show.\r\n\r\nI will break down the things that merit mentioning in bullet form:\r\n\r\n* Alex airs a video of his 15 year old son Rex challenging David Hogg to a debate. It is one of the most disgraceful, embarrassing, and horrifying things I've ever seen in my life. The way Rex was talking bordered on an Alex Jones impression, and he was using many of Alex's catchphrases. It was very clear that either Alex coached him, or worse, he doesn't realize that he is emulating a horrible role-model. We still believe criticism of Rex himself is off-limits, as he is a child and he is being exploited, but I bring this up because of how poorly it reflects on Alex.\r\n* Alex spends a large chunk of this show screaming about how Muslims want to have sex with children, not realizing that two of his guests on ''this very day's show'', Tommy Robinson and Ted Nugent, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120530013851/http://www.loonwatch.com/2012/05/edl-leader-tommy-robinson-outed-as-child-sex-pest/ have sexually harassed underage girls on Twitter] or [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html adopted a 17 year old when he was 30 so he could have sex with her without her parents protesting]\u00a0(and may have done way worse stuff too). Alex is a complete idiot.\r\n* Alex calls for the indictment of Robert Mueller, screaming vague accusations about him being &quot;on tarmacs.&quot; This is a reference to how Mueller delivered a sample of uranium that was confiscated from criminals to Russian authorities as part of a joint investigation. It was entirely above board, but Alex uses it because he is really scared about the stories that are coming out that notorious fraud-committer Ted Malloch may be in Mueller's cross hairs. And Alex should be concerned. Malloch was very involved in the Brexit campaign, and he was a behind-the-scenes adviser for the Trump campaign, the common thread between those things being Cambridge Analytica. If Mueller is speaking to Malloch, that is a pretty obvious sign that they have some information that his role in those two campaigns may have been connected.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond those main points that are pretty interesting, there are a few stray things Alex says here and there that seem very weird, but also seem kind of like him speaking extemporaneously. For instance, he says that he likes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. That seems strange, but since he doesn't really get into it, I'll wait until he elaborates to judge what he's talking about.\r\n\r\nAlso, Alex goes on a collaborative rant with Tommy Robinson about how the Russians did not try to kill Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The rest of the world is pretty much in consensus that they did, but I guess Alex has better information. He's usually right about everything.\r\n\r\nThe two of them scream about how &quot;they&quot; aren't even telling people if the ex-spy and his daughter are alive, which is weird because that is a [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/29/597937016/daughter-of-ex-russian-spy-improving-rapidly-u-k-health-officials-say very easy piece of information to find].\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the rant is when Alex posits that if Russia was behind the attempted murder, they wouldn't have used a nerve agent, because smart assassins use &quot;a bag.&quot; Alright, Alex.\r\n\r\nDoug Hagman hosted the 4th Hour of the show, and I only watched a little bit of it because he's very boring, but thankfully I didn't turn it right off. In the beginning of their interview, Alex reveals that he definitely believes that the &quot;Globalists&quot; drink children's blood and that they need to scare them to produce adrenochrome.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis man loves to pretend he's just talking metaphorically when he calls people vampires, because he knows that when he makes the accusations literal, as he does here, it's really easy to see how most of his beliefs about the &quot;Globalists&quot; are just slight variations on generations old Blood Libel and other antisemitic propaganda.\r\n",

Incidentally, he's also terrible at political cartooning. It's not even that his conservative worldview is what makes the cartoons bad, it's more that he has a strange habit of labeling everything in his cartoons which is really the sign of a lack of craft. If the point you're trying to make isn't clear without labels on everything, it may be a sign that you need to work harder.

That was an issue left unsettled by the Supreme Court until then, and even in that decision, the judges came to a 5-4 decision.</p><p>Before then, the second amendment was more or less understood in its historical context, specifically that states had the right to keep militias to protect themselves from encroachment by other states or the federal government. It is a matter of great debate whether or not this was ever intended to guarantee the right of an individual to own a firearm.</p><p>The argument that Stevens lays out is that the National Rifle Association, a special interest group, is behind the muddying of the waters. Their deceitful efforts to apply the second amendment to fight against any regulations about gun ownership went so far that former Chief Justice Burger said that the NRA was perpetuating \"one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\"</p><p>Stevens suggests that the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to maintain a militia, is obsolete. Further, the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to individual ownership of guns, is not a fully decided matter. As such, he says that gun-control advocates should just try to propose a new amendment that would undo the second amendment, which would in turn cripple the NRA's ability to block legislation that would protect citizens.</p><p>I'm not sure if I totally agree with his argument, but I respect it as being offered in good faith by someone who knows the issues, and I do not think Alex read the article.</p><p>The truth is that there is no need to repeal an amendment, since even in DC vs. Heller, the decision provided by the Supreme Court very clearly pointed out that <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the second amendment is compatible with gun-control regulations</a>:</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote null\" data-block-type=\"31\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1522506897500_175188\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<figure>\n<blockquote data-animation-override=\"\" data-animation-role=\"quote\">\n<span>\u201c</span>Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* '''Ben Garrison''': Garrison is perhaps the most prominent conservative political cartoonist alive today. Incidentally, he's also terrible at political cartooning. It's not even that his conservative worldview is what makes the cartoons bad, it's more that he has a strange habit of labeling everything in his cartoons which is really the sign of a lack of craft. If the point you're trying to make isn't clear without labels on everything, it may be a sign that you need to work harder. Garrison appears on the show in a silly cowboy hat, which I did enjoy.\r\n* '''Jack Posobiec''': Posobiec is a Trump-hack &quot;journalist&quot; who also [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-jack-posobiecya-busted seriously pushed the idea that Pizzagate was a sex dungeon in the non-existent basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizza]. He was outed as being in &quot;military intelligence,&quot; but in reality what that meant was that he was doing piss tests on Marines. Jack has had his hands in far too many fraudulent media propaganda campaigns (Macron Leaks, the &quot;Rape Melania&quot; sign, etc)\u00a0to detail all of them. Alex treats him as if he is some kind of expert on international relations, which is hilarious.\u00a0Jack really sucks.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nOn this show, Alex unveils a video (made by Darren McBreen) which shows footage from the March For Our Lives, mostly footage of the kids who survived the Parkland shooting and aren't thrilled about having to have gone through that, and juxtaposes it with audio of Hitler:\r\n\r\nA lot of people got understandably mad about this, but as far as I can tell, this is just one of Alex's standard publicity stunts. He knows that if he does something like this, thousands of people will tweet about him, people will write articles about him, and he will get an absurd amount of free press. He's the P.T. Barnum of bigoted political speech.\r\n\r\nAlex's rhetoric is repulsive, and he should be ashamed of himself, but this is still an instance of him operating within the realm of free speech to a certain extent. Society would be much better off if they ignored him when he says stuff like this, and made a bigger deal of his overt white nationalism (last week, he said that &quot;whites are being exterminated in Rhodesia&quot;).\r\n\r\nOnce Alex gets to the news, one of his main stories is about how former Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens has come out against the 2nd amendment:\r\n\r\nAlex is referring to an opinion piece that Stevens wrote for The New York Times, and I am guessing that Alex just read the headline, &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html Repeal The Second Amendment]&quot; and that was enough for him to know what it was all about.\r\n\r\nThe argument that Stevens is making is that until 2008, in District of Columbia vs. Heller, the second amendment was not legally understood to mean that individuals had the right to own guns. That was an issue left unsettled by the Supreme Court until then, and even in that decision, the judges came to a 5-4 decision.\r\n\r\nBefore then, the second amendment was more or less understood in its historical context, specifically that states had the right to keep militias to protect themselves from encroachment by other states or the federal government. It is a matter of great debate whether or not this was ever intended to guarantee the right of an individual to own a firearm.\r\n\r\nThe argument that Stevens lays out is that the National Rifle Association, a special interest group, is behind the muddying of the waters. Their deceitful efforts to apply the second amendment to fight against any regulations about gun ownership went so far that former Chief Justice Burger said that the NRA was perpetuating &quot;one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.&quot;\r\n\r\nStevens suggests that the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to maintain a militia, is obsolete. Further, the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to individual ownership of guns, is not a fully decided matter. As such, he says that gun-control advocates should just try to propose a new amendment that would undo the second amendment, which would in turn cripple the NRA's ability to block legislation that would protect citizens.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I totally agree with his argument, but I respect it as being offered in good faith by someone who knows the issues, and I do not think Alex read the article.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there is no need to repeal an amendment, since even in DC vs. Heller, the decision provided by the Supreme Court very clearly pointed out that [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf the second amendment is compatible with gun-control regulations]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cLike most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court\u2019s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\n\u2014 DC vs. Heller, p. 2\r\n\r\nThe debate is not Pro-Gun People vs. Anti-Gun People; what we are living in is a coordinated campaign against rationality and decency being carried out by the NRA and the media/political figures that they have paid off.\r\n\r\nAround the second hour of the show, Alex has political cartoonist Ben Garrison on the show, and what ends up happening is a pretty hilarious scene. Alex's earpiece isn't working at the beginning of the interview, so he is unable to communicate with Garrison:\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with this, Alex just has Garrison vamp and ramble while he tries to fix his earpiece behind the scenes. Unfortunately, Alex forgot to turn off his mic, and some of his yelling was caught on air while Garrison was trying to make some stupid point about Karl Marx:\r\n\r\nThe rest of the interview is not really that interesting. It's just Alex telling Garrison that his work is perfect. It's so good, says Alex. Consider below, a sample of Garrison's work:\r\n\r\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522525012484-3R9RM72E1ZZ8CW0A1IHB/ben.jpg|thumb|none]]\r\n\r\nIf you zoom in, you'll see &quot;Gang&quot; as a label on the guy's head inside the saloon that has no ice.\r\n\r\nAlso, considering that Alex and Roger Stone are currently pushing the narrative that Jeff Sessions has dementia and needs to be taken out of office, I'm not sure even Alex would sign off on this one. Odds are Alex doesn't even like Garrison's work, he's probably just angling for a way to sell his comics on InfoWars' website and make a little cut of the money.\r\n\r\nOn this episode, Alex begins to predict that &quot;something big&quot; is coming, and that he feels a &quot;disturbance in the force that he hasn't felt since just before 9/11.&quot; This sounds pretty extreme, but it's that language is something he employs all the time.

We also philosophically agree with her that female genital mutilation must end.

Alex seems to not know that <a href=\"https://casetext.com/posts/reed-v-reed-some-background\" target=\"_blank\">it was completely legal to just not allow women to practice law in the United States until 1971</a>. This is to say nothing about how until very recently, the idea of beating your wife was so common and uncontroversial that it was a frequent joke in popular culture.</p><p>If these are some of the manifestations of a culture that \"worships women,\" we need to examine what the hell worshiping means.

[https://marias.org.uk/shazia-hobbs-forced-to-marry-and-violently-abused-under-sharia-in-the-uk/ When she was 18], she was made to have an arranged marriage that she did not want, which resulted in her suffering great abuse and beatings from her husband. After 3 years, she left her husband and was disowned by her former community. This is a tragic story, and we empathize with her greatly. We also philosophically agree with her that female genital mutilation must end. All that said, all of her credibility goes directly into the rubbish bin because she is [https://tommyrobinson.online/2018/03/meet-shazia-hobbs/ clearly working with Tommy Robinson], noted conman and xenophobic agitator.

All that said, genital mutilation is a problem, and there are a [http://16days.thepixelproject.net/16-organisations-charities-and-grassroots-groups-working-to-stop-fgm/ lot of non-Tommy Robinson related organizations] working hard to stop it.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nMost of the first hour of the show is dedicated to building up and screaming about anti-China narratives. Part of this is absolutely rooted in providing cover for Russia by saying, &quot;but what about China, they're the real bad guys!&quot;\r\n\r\nThis argument would hold more water if the things that Alex chose to criticize China about were more rooted in reality. Take, for example, this clip:\r\n\r\nAccording to Alex Jones, China has the &quot;keys to the kingdom,&quot; an analogue to something in the movie Elysium, because of course it's something from a movie. He's making the claim that China has control over all our telecommunications and that Google gave them that access recently.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Alex is lying about what Google did. [http://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-icloud-china-iphone-data-privacy If you read the actual story], it's very clear that what Google did (which still isn't great) is that they moved the encryption keys for Chinese Google iCloud users to a local company in China, which all but guarantees that the government will have access to users' information. This has literally nothing to do with iCloud data for customers around the world; they are not encryption keys for anything except Chinese users.\r\n\r\nA legitimate criticism would be that Google should defend privacy, and maybe should choose to cease doing business in China, rather than give the government free reign to access users' data. An illegitimate one is what Alex is doing: creating a fake version of the story to scream about because it kind of fits in with his larger conspiracies about China and Google.\r\n\r\nAlex spends a lot of time on the show kind of obsessed about how cultures treat women. His contention is that the West is &quot;based on worshiping women:&quot;\r\n\r\nHis argument fails to account for the fact that women weren't allowed to vote for the first 144 years that America was a thing. It also fails to account for the fact that until 1922, women lost their citizenship if they married a foreigner, because it was just assumed that she had to be subservient to her husband (women still wouldn't be able to retain their citizenship if they married an Asian man until 1931). Alex seems to not know that [https://casetext.com/posts/reed-v-reed-some-background it was completely legal to just not allow women to practice law in the United States until 1971]. This is to say nothing about how until very recently, the idea of beating your wife was so common and uncontroversial that it was a frequent joke in popular culture.\r\n\r\nIf these are some of the manifestations of a culture that &quot;worships women,&quot; we need to examine what the hell worshiping means. We know damn well what he's talking about, and false worship is nothing more than a bullshit public face for suppression and cultural abuse.\r\n\r\nAlso, this sort of shit would sound a lot less like a rationalization for him to treat women like things (instead of as autonomous individuals), if he didn't say that a female caller was sexy, completely unprompted later on this very show:\r\n\r\nAlex has an interview on this episode with Shazia Hobbs, and most of it is just Alex trying to use it as an opportunity to attack London mayor Sadiq Khan as an &quot;Islamacist.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhat this came from is that in a video for the End The Hate campaign, Khan read a tweet of Hobbs's and editorialized that she was preaching hate. For context, the text of her tweet is as follows:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cIf you use a knife to mutilate your daughter\u2019s vagina will the full force of the law be brought down on you? Asking for a Muslim. Thanks.\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nI'm thinking, possibly, that the reason one might have a negative response to this tweet is the &quot;asking for a Muslim&quot; part. It kind of paints the picture that Muslims are the only people who engage in genital mutilation, which is patently absurd. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110570413000258 Christians throughout Africa engage in the practice], among plenty of other groups around the world. It's not an Islam issue, it is a men abusing women issue.\r\n\r\nThis highlights one of the very interesting hypocrisies of Alex Jones and his circle's approach to Islam. On the one hand, they argue that all Muslims are violent and dangerous because they believe that the Koran is violent, and Islam is a very orthodox religion. They make this argument to imply that whatever words are literally in the Koran, all Muslims must literally follow.\r\n\r\nBut then, as it relates to female genital mutilation, they will ignore that the prophet Mohammed said:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cTrim, but do not cut into it, for this is brighter for the face (of the girl) and more favorable with the husband\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nThey will ignore that Islamic scholars have interpreted the texts on the issue to be prohibiting of the behavior of genital mutilation, but permissive of circumcisions that do no harm to the recipient.\u00a0Dr. Abd al-Rahm\u00e2n b. Hasan al-Nafisah [https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/442/female-circumcision-in-islam-part-2/ wrote an article on Islam and female circumcision] where he concluded:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cIn Islamic Law, preservation of the person \u2013 the life and bodily soundness of the person \u2013 is a legal necessity.

It is completely heartbreaking stuff to see.\r\n\r\nBut then, in a moment where Alex was hoping to prove that his 15 year-old son was speaking freely and there wasn't a teleprompter, the camera panned over and caught a glimpse of off-camera Alex:\r\n\r\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522558435730-CH6MK8BEGUBWVDVWKD28/0.jpg|thumb|none]]\r\n\r\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522558411932-5TYOKOH1MD15CA1RK8ZO/000000.jpg|thumb|none]]\r\n\r\nIs that just a cup of water? Seems unlikely, considering Alex's penchant for drinking at the office, and his on-air behavior during these special reports. Here is a clip of him rambling and making no sense, and keep in mind, while he's saying this blather, his son is sitting right next to him:\r\n\r\nAll this is just terrible stuff. It's not even offensive in the normal way Alex is offensive; it's repellent on a visceral, human level. That said, we're still not calling for Alex to be kicked off anything, but we are sincerely begging for him to feel a modicum of shame about his behavior.\r\n",

We know that much, but it's not super clear what his experience entails. What we do know for sure is that Bracken has written a number of books about his societal collapse fantasies, books that suspiciously track very closely with the InfoWars view of what the future is going to look like. Bracken has a real serious streak of being an anti-Islamic bigot, but perhaps most importantly, he has drew a diagram of what he thinks the second Civil War (\"CW2\") is going to look like, and it is ludicrous.

He was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC5pDeuQzE\" target=\"_blank\">trained by Edward Bernays</a> as a propagandist, and has plied his trade shilling for the right wing for years. He has written multiple books about how <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wheres-Birth-Certificate-Eligible-President-ebook/dp/B01EYY7VJU/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522780415&amp;sr=1-6&amp;refinements=p_27%3AJerome+Corsi\" target=\"_blank\">Barack Obama's birth certificate is fake</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unfit-Command-Swift-Veterans-Against-ebook/dp/B001WAK8HC/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1522780448&amp;sr=1-4&amp;refinements=p_27%3AJerome+Corsi\" target=\"_blank\">his writing was an integral part of the disgraceful smear campaign against John Kerry</a>, the Swiftboating, during the 2004 election. Over his time at InfoWars, he's been responsible for some of the worst reporting on staff, because he tries to go big, which inevitably involves him faceplanting, most entertainingly in <a href=\"http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-dennis-montgomery-investigation\" target=\"_blank\">the time he tried to team with Joe Arpaio's team to push bullshit</a>, or the time <a href=\"http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-may-25-2017\" target=\"_blank\">he pretended he'd uncovered a scoop that would get him murdered by \"the Globalists</a>.\" In early 2018, Corsi lost his mind and started spending all his time \"decoding\" messages left on message boards by \"QAnon.\" It is looking like this is the final embarrassing chapter in a profoundly embarrassing career.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Narratives</strong></em>:</p><p>Today is mostly about sales. Alex is doing long, long commercials through most of the show. If I had to guess, I would say that this is probably because in the last 24 hours, both <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-jones-another-defamation-lawsuit_us_5abe758ee4b055e50acd5e45?utm_campaign=hp_fb_pages&amp;utm_source=politics_fb&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000013&amp;section=politics\" target=\"_blank\">Alex</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2018/04/chinese-billionaire-wallops-roger-stone-100-million-defamation-suit-infowars-screeds/\" target=\"_blank\">Roger Stone</a> have been served new lawsuits related to their on-air activities on InfoWars.</p><p>The lawsuit against Alex is a little weak, and even though Alex's behavior is terrible, he's probably completely protected by the freedom of the press in the case that is being brought against him.</p><p>Roger, on the other hand, could get hit pretty hard. If the guy suing him can prove that Roger made inaccurate claims/accusations about him on InfoWars, that could end in a legitimate slander/libel case. Malicious intent is very hard to prove in court, but if there's one guy who it would be pretty easy to demonstrate having malicious intent, it would be Roger.</p><p>We will see how that all plays out, but for now, suffice it to say that Alex knows he needs a ton of money because this onslaught of lawsuits is probably not going to end any time soon.</p><p>In the middle of the show, Alex sits down with Matt Bracken to talk about how Trump has indicated that he is sending military troops to the Mexican border to defend against...caravans of immigrants? Whatever the reality is with this caravan, Alex is reporting this news for the same reason Trump is: trying to score points with their audience over non-issues. In this case, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/the-caravan-of-migrants-thats-alarmed-president-trump-has-now-stalled/2018/04/03/534b01c2-36aa-11e8-af3c-2123715f78df_story.html?utm_term=.2d77ef8a0e3d\" target=\"_blank\">Mexico had already stopped the caravan at least 12 hours before</a> Alex got on air and reported that it was an emergency.</p><p>Whether or not it is wise to deal with civilian populations trying to seek asylum by deploying the military is a larger issue and not something we can settle today.

It usually comes from an unhealthy place, especially when you are implying that the reason to keep an eye on them is to kill them once it is the time to kill (which Alex constantly makes clear that that time will come).</p><p>Alex is absolutely trying to incite violence, and make no mistake about it, the \"Globalists\" aren't a real group. It is a dog-whistle term for Jews, and it is intellectually dishonest to pretend that Alex's audience does not understand this on some level. The idea that he is telling his audience to keep an eye on the \"Globalist\" in your town is a very, very fucked up thing for him to say, but it is probably just barely on the right side of free speech laws.</p><p>At the end of the show, Alex plays a bit from a \"documentary\" he shot where he goes to Ted Nugent's ranch and the two of them talked shit about liberals and shot guns a bunch. It's a mess, and <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html\" target=\"_blank\">knowing Ted Nugent's dicey history</a>, I just have a tough time taking anything he says as sincere.

He was [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiC5pDeuQzE trained by Edward Bernays] as a propagandist, and has plied his trade shilling for the right wing for years. He has written multiple books about how [https://www.amazon.com/Wheres-Birth-Certificate-Eligible-President-ebook/dp/B01EYY7VJU/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1522780415&sr=1-6&refinements=p_27%3AJerome+Corsi Barack Obama's birth certificate is fake], and [https://www.amazon.com/Unfit-Command-Swift-Veterans-Against-ebook/dp/B001WAK8HC/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1522780448&sr=1-4&refinements=p_27%3AJerome+Corsi his writing was an integral part of the disgraceful smear campaign against John Kerry], the Swiftboating, during the 2004 election. Over his time at InfoWars, he's been responsible for some of the worst reporting on staff, because he tries to go big, which inevitably involves him faceplanting, most entertainingly in [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-dennis-montgomery-investigation the time he tried to team with Joe Arpaio's team to push bullshit], or the time [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-may-25-2017 he pretended he'd uncovered a scoop that would get him murdered by &quot;the Globalists].&quot; In early 2018, Corsi lost his mind and started spending all his time &quot;decoding&quot; messages left on message boards by &quot;QAnon.&quot; It is looking like this is the final embarrassing chapter in a profoundly embarrassing career.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nToday is mostly about sales. Alex is doing long, long commercials through most of the show. If I had to guess, I would say that this is probably because in the last 24 hours, both [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alex-jones-another-defamation-lawsuit_us_5abe758ee4b055e50acd5e45?utm_campaign=hp_fb_pages&utm_source=politics_fb&utm_medium=facebook&ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000013&section=politics Alex] and [https://www.rawstory.com/2018/04/chinese-billionaire-wallops-roger-stone-100-million-defamation-suit-infowars-screeds/ Roger Stone] have been served new lawsuits related to their on-air activities on InfoWars.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit against Alex is a little weak, and even though Alex's behavior is terrible, he's probably completely protected by the freedom of the press in the case that is being brought against him.\r\n\r\nRoger, on the other hand, could get hit pretty hard. If the guy suing him can prove that Roger made inaccurate claims/accusations about him on InfoWars, that could end in a legitimate slander/libel case. Malicious intent is very hard to prove in court, but if there's one guy who it would be pretty easy to demonstrate having malicious intent, it would be Roger.\r\n\r\nWe will see how that all plays out, but for now, suffice it to say that Alex knows he needs a ton of money because this onslaught of lawsuits is probably not going to end any time soon.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the show, Alex sits down with Matt Bracken to talk about how Trump has indicated that he is sending military troops to the Mexican border to defend against...caravans of immigrants? Whatever the reality is with this caravan, Alex is reporting this news for the same reason Trump is: trying to score points with their audience over non-issues. In this case, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/the-caravan-of-migrants-thats-alarmed-president-trump-has-now-stalled/2018/04/03/534b01c2-36aa-11e8-af3c-2123715f78df_story.html?utm_term=.2d77ef8a0e3d Mexico had already stopped the caravan at least 12 hours before] Alex got on air and reported that it was an emergency.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it is wise to deal with civilian populations trying to seek asylum by deploying the military is a larger issue and not something we can settle today. Actually we can; it's a horrible idea.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnother horrible idea is something that Alex says in his interview with Bracken:\r\n\r\nThat is next-level dangerous rhetoric. Historically, people saying that you need to keep your eyes on a certain population is a very negative thing. It usually comes from an unhealthy place, especially when you are implying that the reason to keep an eye on them is to kill them once it is the time to kill (which Alex constantly makes clear that that time will come).\r\n\r\nAlex is absolutely trying to incite violence, and make no mistake about it, the &quot;Globalists&quot; aren't a real group. It is a dog-whistle term for Jews, and it is intellectually dishonest to pretend that Alex's audience does not understand this on some level. The idea that he is telling his audience to keep an eye on the &quot;Globalist&quot; in your town is a very, very fucked up thing for him to say, but it is probably just barely on the right side of free speech laws.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the show, Alex plays a bit from a &quot;documentary&quot; he shot where he goes to Ted Nugent's ranch and the two of them talked shit about liberals and shot guns a bunch. It's a mess, and [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html knowing Ted Nugent's dicey history], I just have a tough time taking anything he says as sincere. He's an asshole who loves guns and being in charge; all the rest of the supposed principles are just bullshit. Everyone on InfoWars is a conman.\r\n",

The only person who knows about this book is Alex Jones, and he only knows one line of it, which he lies about.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOne thing that's interesting to note is that, in 2009, Alex Jones thinks that Blackwater are a bunch of &quot;murdering thugs:&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is interesting, seeing how in 2018, Alex is very pro-Erik Prince, going so far as to say that he is a super-patriot. Goes to show just how far he's gone down the road of hypocrisy; even people he called a war criminal yesterday are super patriots today, just because they are involved with Donald Trump.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that is of note, perhaps, is that Alex lists the Rockefellers and the Hearsts as people he names as Globalists, but at this point, there is no mention of George Soros at all.\r\n\r\nProbably not too surprisingly, Alex ends the show by having a representative from Midas Resources come on air to list their current coin prices:\r\n\r\nThis is probably unethical, considering how he's doing a show built around convincing his audience that the GM bankruptcy is going to soon spread to all companies and paper money will be eliminated. But, we're not experts in business ethics.\r\n",

Once again, it is a tactic Alex is employing to kill time and run out the clock between ads, while spreading antisemitic slanders left and right.</p><p>In terms of actual revelations of this show, there's not a whole lot. One thing we learn is that Alex's planned \"press conference\" (read: \"publicity stunt\") at the DC Press Club (which anyone can rent out to create the air of legitimacy around their lunatic nonsense) will involve him announcing the first two of ten lawsuits Alex is filing against \"enemies of the republic.\" Fingers crossed that we are one of them.</p><p>The only thing in this episode probably worth mentioning is Alex celebrating Donald Trump's move to send military to the Mexican border to \"protect the country.\"</p><p>This is a complicated issue, and I think a lot of people criticizing Alex for this are not attacking it in the right way. Here is the situation, as I see it.</p><p>For most of his career, Alex Jones has been severely anti-cop and anti-military. During the Bush and Obama presidencies, he viewed these service people as being tools of an evil government, and he was against them, almost universally. He would be careful to say that there were some good cops and some good soldiers, but he was clear that he was against the organizations in the bigger picture.</p><p>He would constantly rail on the Posse Comitatus Act and how that made it illegal for the military to operate in any way involving domestic policies. During Jade Helm in 2015, he made a huge deal out of how this was an encroachment of Posse Comitatus. That is only one of the more high-profile instances where he screamed about domestic use of the military.</p><p>Now, where things get murky about calling Alex a hypocrite for supporting Trump in this move is that the troops Trump is sending are National Guard troops, which are not included in the prohibitions of the Posse Comitatus Act.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* '''None'''. Roger Stone pops in for an hour to create strawman arguments about how he's getting sued and people are starting to point out inconsistencies in his story about whether or not he's talked to Julian Assange in the lead up to their release of hacked emails. He doesn't count as a guest because he's on every day, but today's appearance was a little longer than usual.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nAlex spends a lot of the beginning of the show repeating bullshit narratives about George Soros. Once again, it is a tactic Alex is employing to kill time and run out the clock between ads, while spreading antisemitic slanders left and right.\r\n\r\nIn terms of actual revelations of this show, there's not a whole lot. One thing we learn is that Alex's planned &quot;press conference&quot; (read: &quot;publicity stunt&quot;) at the DC Press Club (which anyone can rent out to create the air of legitimacy around their lunatic nonsense) will involve him announcing the first two of ten lawsuits Alex is filing against &quot;enemies of the republic.&quot; Fingers crossed that we are one of them.\r\n\r\nThe only thing in this episode probably worth mentioning is Alex celebrating Donald Trump's move to send military to the Mexican border to &quot;protect the country.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is a complicated issue, and I think a lot of people criticizing Alex for this are not attacking it in the right way. Here is the situation, as I see it.\r\n\r\nFor most of his career, Alex Jones has been severely anti-cop and anti-military. During the Bush and Obama presidencies, he viewed these service people as being tools of an evil government, and he was against them, almost universally. He would be careful to say that there were some good cops and some good soldiers, but he was clear that he was against the organizations in the bigger picture.\r\n\r\nHe would constantly rail on the Posse Comitatus Act and how that made it illegal for the military to operate in any way involving domestic policies. During Jade Helm in 2015, he made a huge deal out of how this was an encroachment of Posse Comitatus. That is only one of the more high-profile instances where he screamed about domestic use of the military.\r\n\r\nNow, where things get murky about calling Alex a hypocrite for supporting Trump in this move is that the troops Trump is sending are National Guard troops, which are not included in the prohibitions of the Posse Comitatus Act. Saying that Alex is being inconsistent here is not quite fair.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Posse Comitatus Act does make it very clear that it was [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385 only referring to the Army and Air Force]. National Guard troops can be sent in to aid in a situation, if they are invited to do so by that state's governor. It turns out that some of the states involved do not want the National Guard to come in and &quot;help,&quot; so this is where things could get messy.\r\n\r\nFurther, there is a precedent that when the President deems it necessary to enforce federal laws, they may decide to send in troops in contradiction of the act. The issue with this being Alex's justification for supporting Trump's actions is that: 1) the troops are likely not going to be enforcing legitimate federal laws, and 2) he would never allow this kind of argument if it were a different president doing it.\r\n\r\nMy bottom line point about this is that, according to the Posse Comitatus Act, the act of sending in the National Guard is up to the governors of the states. As long as Alex is in recognition of this, he's not being a complete hypocrite.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe rest of the show is stupid deflections about the lawsuits that are being filed against Alex and Roger Stone. Roger comes on to defend himself about that email he sent saying he'd &quot;dined with Assange&quot; (it was a joke), but mysteriously does not bring up how he is [https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/roger-stone-sued-for-defamation-by-guo-wengui-10229139 being sued for $100 million by Miles Kwok], who is claiming defamation that Roger did on InfoWars. He probably doesn't want to talk about that, because he is most likely in serious trouble on that front.\r\n",

The problem there is that in the clip from Jan. 13, 2015, he clearly says \"I couldn't believe it at first,\" when talking about how he now believes the whole event was fake.

He only reads the headlines and first paragraphs of stories he covers. He has clearly never read any of the \"Globalist\" writings he pretends support his worldview (since most of them say the exact opposite of what he claims they do). And most importantly, he never, ever confirms or proves anything.</p><p>He goes on air and reports gossip as fact, message board posts as truth, misunderstandings as proof of conspiracy. This is a dangerous game, because it will eventually lead you to believe things that are absolutely not true, but you've built up too big a narrative to let any piece of it slip without letting the entire thing fall.</p><p>All of the pieces of Alex's Sandy Hook narrative, that he was pushing <em>way</em> past a year after the tragedy, are thoroughly debunked. All of the things he's bringing up to defend himself in the present are things that he can't prove (e.g. the clearly fake \"Antifa/Soros contracts\" one of his interns found on 4chan, and then they reported as being real). This is a big building built on nothing.</p><p>The problem with the game he is playing is that you cannot say that \"they used actors\" at Sandy Hook without your listeners/followers taking that logic to the next step. If they used actors, then all of the grieving families by definition have to be in on it. They aren't innocent victims of tragedy; they're evil villains who need to be exposed. By perpetuating the pieces of the narrative that Alex very definitely did, he brought unimaginable and horrifying abuse into the lives of people who had already suffered the worst pain imaginable in losing a young child to senseless murder.</p><p>Alex is perhaps lucky that the families of the victims did not sue him sooner. If the reality of his words and actions could be considered in court, he would be dead to rights, but legal technicalities may get him off the hook on this one. Either way, he is anything but innocent, and should be deeply ashamed of himself.</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>",

The problem there is that in the clip from Jan. 13, 2015, he clearly says &quot;I couldn't believe it at first,&quot; when talking about how he now believes the whole event was fake. That clearly implies that something had to have &quot;convinced&quot; him of that, which suggests strongly that &quot;going over the evidence&quot; led him not to believe the exact opposite of what he is pretending it did in modern day.\r\n\r\n3) Alex Will Not Stop Saying Tar Baby\r\n\r\nThis is really nothing to do strictly with Sandy Hook, it's just super upsetting.\r\n\r\n4) Alex Lies About Not Saying People At Sandy Hook Were Actors\r\n\r\nIn the clip from Jan. 13, 2015, Alex repeatedly says that &quot;they used actors.&quot; He wants to hide behind this facade of saying &quot;I never said they were actors&quot; when that is literally exactly what he said.\r\n\r\nThe issue that we are dealing with is that Alex Jones is a very dumb, lazy guy. He only reads the headlines and first paragraphs of stories he covers. He has clearly never read any of the &quot;Globalist&quot; writings he pretends support his worldview (since most of them say the exact opposite of what he claims they do). And most importantly, he never, ever confirms or proves anything.\r\n\r\nHe goes on air and reports gossip as fact, message board posts as truth, misunderstandings as proof of conspiracy. This is a dangerous game, because it will eventually lead you to believe things that are absolutely not true, but you've built up too big a narrative to let any piece of it slip without letting the entire thing fall.\r\n\r\nAll of the pieces of Alex's Sandy Hook narrative, that he was pushing ''way'' past a year after the tragedy, are thoroughly debunked. All of the things he's bringing up to defend himself in the present are things that he can't prove (e.g. the clearly fake &quot;Antifa/Soros contracts&quot; one of his interns found on 4chan, and then they reported as being real). This is a big building built on nothing.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the game he is playing is that you cannot say that &quot;they used actors&quot; at Sandy Hook without your listeners/followers taking that logic to the next step. If they used actors, then all of the grieving families by definition have to be in on it. They aren't innocent victims of tragedy; they're evil villains who need to be exposed. By perpetuating the pieces of the narrative that Alex very definitely did, he brought unimaginable and horrifying abuse into the lives of people who had already suffered the worst pain imaginable in losing a young child to senseless murder.\r\n\r\nAlex is perhaps lucky that the families of the victims did not sue him sooner. If the reality of his words and actions could be considered in court, he would be dead to rights, but legal technicalities may get him off the hook on this one. Either way, he is anything but innocent, and should be deeply ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n",

On the one hand, he has a decades long history of activism, engaging in occupations and protests against the mistreatment of Native Peoples in America. On the other hand, he is probably also a crazy person. For instance, he was ready to sign up as Vice President to campaign with Larry Flynt in 1983. For another, he was arrested for assault and battery of his 80 year-old father (who had one false arm), and <a href=\"https://www.aimovement.org/moipr/onrussellmeans.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 1999 the American Indian Movement (AIM) put out a press release repudiating him</a> and saying that, though he may represent himself as involved with AIM, he was not. As is so often the case on this show, it appears we are dealing with a con-man.</li><li><strong>Bob Chapman</strong>: Bob Chapman is an absolute mystery, and all I can tell you for certain about him is that there is something very sinister afoot in his life. For one thing, <a href=\"http://theinternationalforecaster.com/page/bob_chapman\" target=\"_blank\">he claims that he was \"probably the largest gold and silver stockbroker in the world\" from 1970-1988</a>, a claim that if true would have to make Bob at very least a multi-billionaire, which raises the question of why he would appear on InfoWars to shill gold at age 73 if he was a billionaire. It doesn't add up. But then, you peel back the next layer, and you learn that until 1976 he focused his gold business almost entirely on South African (apartheid era South African) gold, in fact he spent the years 1970-1973 living in apartheid era South Africa and the short-lived literal white nationalist state Rhodesia. He helped Gary Allen finance the printing of his book None Dare Call It Conspiracy (the book that \"woke Alex Jones up\") with money he was making from stealing South African resources and while he was living in apartheid countries in Africa. Also, one time, <a href=\"http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-january-7-2011\" target=\"_blank\">he claimed he saw a video of Ronald Reagan getting butt-fucked</a>.</li><li><strong>Alan Watt</strong>: Alan Watt is not Alan Watts.

When Israeli snipers shot and killed over 50 Palestinians in May of 2018, most of them completely unarmed and peacefully demonstrating, Alex's response was to affirm his support of Israel, and to play rhetorical \"what about this?\" type games about how bad he thinks Muslims are, lying about \"hourly suicide bombings\" that the media doesn't report:</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527210542299_152912\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"May 14, 2018\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"58000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Alex Just Doesn't Like Muslims\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5b0777b7575d1f998b6c8d6a/1527216056559/8-AlexReadsIsraelNews-SomehowMakesItAboutIslamBeingBad.mp3/original/8-AlexReadsIsraelNews-SomehowMakesItAboutIslamBeingBad.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527210542299_152978\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>We can see here a major pivot in his position. This is something that demands an explanation, and I do not trust the one that Alex would offer up, namely that he \"didn't realize how evil Islam was in 2009.\" Alex's rhetoric about the \"Globalists\" wanting to flood \"Western\" (he means \"white\") countries with immigrants in order to destroy their economies, is alive and well in 2009. This is one of the things he claims is his biggest issues with Islam, and it's a complaint he is making in 2009, so I reject that as what has changed for him.</p><p>It is hard to say without having all the evidence at our disposal, but this is going to be something that we watch very closely as 2009 progresses. As it stands, this is one of the most glaring examples of something that needs explaining that we've found in the past so far.</p><p>[Note: we in no way believe that this is an indication that Alex works for Israel or Mossad. The people who put forth those sorts of theories generally seem to hold to a particular belief system that we do not think is a coincidence. I don't rule out any possibility, but all \"evidence\" I've seen has been very weak, and there are many other possible explanations for why Alex changed his position on Israel]</p><p>2)<strong> Alex Is In Very Deep As A Gold Con-Man</strong></p><p>For a long time, it's been perfectly clear that Alex is running a gold-sales scam at the behest of Ted Anderson, owner of the Genesis Communications Network and the gold/silver outlet Midas Resources.</p><p>How I imagined it, Alex is kind of crazy and paranoid to begin with, but he's in enough control of it to be able to use it to sell things. He probably does believe that the \"Globalists\" are putting things in the water, but he also knows that if he yells about it more and exaggerates the danger, he will sell more units for his water filtration sponsors. He probably is a Doomsday Prepper-type at heart, but if he amps up how passionate he seems about fearing that the end is coming, that translates to more sales for his survival food sponsor. I made the fairly generous assumption that the relationship between Alex's content and his sponsors was incidental or possibly benign.</p><p>After experiencing a bit of 2009 episodes, I no longer think InfoWars is a case of benign or incidental sales. I am becoming more and more convinced that we are not looking at a radio show where the host has positions, and conveniently he has sponsors related to the things he talks about. I am becoming concerned that the advertisements on InfoWars dictate the content.</p><p>On this episode, Alex Jones welcomes Bob Chapman to the show, and they very predictably have a conversation about how the economy and the dollar are about to collapse. They spread a ton of real over the top financial fear, before Bob reaches the natural conclusion of their conversation, telling the audience that the only safe option in the world is gold:</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527210542299_181541\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"Jan. 9, 2009\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"22000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"You Gotta Buy Gold, Says Gold Salesman\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5b0784f21ae6cf2a41718f2c/1527219443856/19-Jan9-BobChapman-TheOnlySafePlaceToBeIsInGold.mp3/original/19-Jan9-BobChapman-TheOnlySafePlaceToBeIsInGold.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527210542299_181607\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>At this point, Bob Chapman straight up just tells Alex's audience that what they need to do is call Midas Resources.

The reality is that people on the internet like to fuck around and 2009 was basically the wild west for this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nWhat Alex is doing is really smart though, painting a run of the mill internet prank as targeted harassment from government shills does make it appear that his work is far more dangerous and based in reality than it actually is. Propaganda truly is about the management of appearances, so it's important for even minor things like this to be presented as sinister attacks against &quot;the republic,&quot; or some shit.\r\n\r\nIt is really stupid, but it does lead to this incredibly stupid attack on Alex's critics:\r\n\r\nRegardless, on to the more important things on this episode. These are very important, so I will need to deal with them as bullet points:\r\n\r\n1) '''Alex Jones Criticizes Israel For Shooting Palestinians'''\r\n\r\nThis is pretty huge, and is diametrically opposed to Alex's position in 2018. When Israeli snipers shot and killed over 50 Palestinians in May of 2018, most of them completely unarmed and peacefully demonstrating, Alex's response was to affirm his support of Israel, and to play rhetorical &quot;what about this?&quot; type games about how bad he thinks Muslims are, lying about &quot;hourly suicide bombings&quot; that the media doesn't report:\r\n\r\nWe can see here a major pivot in his position. This is something that demands an explanation, and I do not trust the one that Alex would offer up, namely that he &quot;didn't realize how evil Islam was in 2009.&quot; Alex's rhetoric about the &quot;Globalists&quot; wanting to flood &quot;Western&quot; (he means &quot;white&quot;) countries with immigrants in order to destroy their economies, is alive and well in 2009. This is one of the things he claims is his biggest issues with Islam, and it's a complaint he is making in 2009, so I reject that as what has changed for him.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say without having all the evidence at our disposal, but this is going to be something that we watch very closely as 2009 progresses. As it stands, this is one of the most glaring examples of something that needs explaining that we've found in the past so far.\r\n\r\n[Note: we in no way believe that this is an indication that Alex works for Israel or Mossad. The people who put forth those sorts of theories generally seem to hold to a particular belief system that we do not think is a coincidence. I don't rule out any possibility, but all &quot;evidence&quot; I've seen has been very weak, and there are many other possible explanations for why Alex changed his position on Israel]\r\n\r\n2) '''Alex Is In Very Deep As A Gold Con-Man'''\r\n\r\nFor a long time, it's been perfectly clear that Alex is running a gold-sales scam at the behest of Ted Anderson, owner of the Genesis Communications Network and the gold/silver outlet Midas Resources.\r\n\r\nHow I imagined it, Alex is kind of crazy and paranoid to begin with, but he's in enough control of it to be able to use it to sell things. He probably does believe that the &quot;Globalists&quot; are putting things in the water, but he also knows that if he yells about it more and exaggerates the danger, he will sell more units for his water filtration sponsors. He probably is a Doomsday Prepper-type at heart, but if he amps up how passionate he seems about fearing that the end is coming, that translates to more sales for his survival food sponsor. I made the fairly generous assumption that the relationship between Alex's content and his sponsors was incidental or possibly benign.\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing a bit of 2009 episodes, I no longer think InfoWars is a case of benign or incidental sales. I am becoming more and more convinced that we are not looking at a radio show where the host has positions, and conveniently he has sponsors related to the things he talks about. I am becoming concerned that the advertisements on InfoWars dictate the content.\r\n\r\nOn this episode, Alex Jones welcomes Bob Chapman to the show, and they very predictably have a conversation about how the economy and the dollar are about to collapse. They spread a ton of real over the top financial fear, before Bob reaches the natural conclusion of their conversation, telling the audience that the only safe option in the world is gold:\r\n\r\nAt this point, Bob Chapman straight up just tells Alex's audience that what they need to do is call Midas Resources. Keep in mind that Bob Chapman is appearing on the show, ostensibly, as a financial expert, not as a booster for Midas Resources, which again, is the company that owns GCN, the company that syndicates Alex's show (and is responsible for most of his ad revenue).\r\n\r\nLeave aside for a second that Bob Chapman buys ads on GCN programming to promote his newsletter, The International Forecaster. Forget that Midas Resources offers a free issue of The International Forecaster along with gold/silver purchases. Actually, scratch that, there is no way to ignore these absurdly intertwined, overlapping, and undisclosed business relationships between these guys. This is absolutely the definition of immoral advertising.\r\n\r\nThis kind of thing should be a huge red flag for anyone listening, and it should be completely clear what is going on as soon as Alex gets Ted Anderson himself on the line to chat with Bob Chapman about how important it is to buy gold and how good the Midas deals are if you want to buy gold NOW!\r\n\r\nThese men are running a very basic con where Alex has someone on as an expert who is actually a shill for Midas Resources. The two of them get the audience ready to hear a gold salespitch, usually by peddling fear based on misrepresentations of news stories or history, and when the audience is good and primed, they bring in the closer, Ted Anderson to give you the deals, deals that you would be so stupid to pass up.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't get ore see-through than this as a con, and if they would be willing to stoop to this level, it really has to call into question all the rest of InfoWars operation. Very likely, the entire thing is probably not above board.\r\n",

Royalty is really goofy though, so Alex could be right in some meaningless technicality kind of way. What I mean is that, technically, Queen Elizabeth owns all the land in England and Canada and everything in it. Functionally, she doesn't, but because royalty is a stupid system, she technically does.</p><p>As for Dutch Royal Shell, it does appear that Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands does have some stock in the company, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/26/0626queens.html#4bfd756b4270\" target=\"_blank\">but it appears to be quite a bit less than Alex is saying</a>:</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote null\" data-block-type=\"31\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527210542299_268562\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<figure>\n<blockquote data-animation-override=\"\" data-animation-role=\"quote\">\n<span>\u201c</span>Most of the wealth comes from the family\u2019s longstanding stake in the U.K. and Netherlands-based oil company, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group .

Where he really drifts into trouble though is as it relates to the Rockefeller family controlling all the oil companies that sell oil in America (other than Shell and BP, that is).</p><p>This is a crazy lie that doesn't stand up to even the most minimal investigation.</p><p>First of all, what are the 12 American oil companies that David Rockefeller allegedly shook down for carbon taxes? Once you get past the top 8 or so American oil companies, you are no longer dealing with giant companies, definitely not ones that would have a big say in implementing \"carbon taxes.\"</p><p>What Alex wants the audience to think is that John D.\u00a0Rockefeller's Standard Oil never actually got broken up, and that the Rockefellers have secretly been running literally all non-Queen related oil in America since forever. This is not true, for a number of reasons.</p><p>In 1911, the Supreme Court ruled that Standard Oil was an illegal monopoly, and it was busted up into companies that would become a bunch of other large oil companies: Chevron, ExxonMobil, Amoco, Texaco, and Marathon, most notably. This is what Alex hopes to misrepresent to his listeners, he wants them to be suspicious that all these companies come from the former monopoly company, Standard Oil, and of course it never really broke up. Why would the Rockefellers be so dumb as to really break up just because a pesky little think like the Supreme Court telling them they have to?</p><p><a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/221/1/\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States</a> did happen, and the end result was that <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Standard-Oil-Company-and-Trust\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Oil was split up into 34 different competing companies</a>, with separate board members, completely autonomous from each other. That is what history shows us, and if Alex can prove otherwise, he needs to do that, instead of just make vague accusations on air.</p><p>The further problem is, even beyond this historical revisionism, Alex just doesn't know what he's talking about. For instance, the second largest American oil company (when this episode came out. <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/241625/top-10-us-oil-and-gas-companies-based-on-market-value/\" target=\"_blank\">They have since slipped down the list to #7</a>),\u00a0Valero Energy was founded in 1980 and <a href=\"https://www.valero.com/en-us/AboutValero/CompanyHistory\" target=\"_blank\">was never a part of Standard Oil or any Rockefeller business</a> (in fact, over the years, Valero has been the one buying up oil interests from former Standard Oil companies like Chevron or Exxon, not the other way around). Also, the fifth largest American oil company, Occidental Petroleum, <a href=\"http://www.oxy.com/aboutOccidental/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">also has nothing to do with Standard Oil</a> or the Rockefeller family. The fourth largest, EOG Resources, has nothing to do with Standard Oil, but does come from the ashes of Enron, so fuck them. The third largest, ConocoPhillips, came from a merger of two companies, Conoco and Phillips 66, neither of which came from Standard Oil (however, Phillips did merge their chemical division with Standard Oil remnant Chevron in 2000, but that's not what Alex is talking about).</p><p>I know that's a lot, but the third, fourth, fifth, and seventh largest American oil companies have nothing to do with the companies left after the break up of Standard Oil. There is no way that David Rockefeller could assert ownership of them, which is something he couldn't do even with ExxonMobil or Chevron on the basis that came from Standard Oil. This is all an unsupported delusional fiction that Alex is spinning as proof that carbon taxes are evil and they're coming.</p><p>The bottom line is that this is very stupid, and Alex is praying that his listeners never look anything up.</p><p>The next big lie that Alex Jones engages in is to talk about Barack Obama's alleged cousin, \"Odinga:\"</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527210542299_292355\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"Jan. 18, 2009\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"41000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Alex Talks About &quot;Obama's Cousin&quot;\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5b07a345f950b75f00ec33e9/1527227207092/4-Jan18-CallerSuggestsObamaIsAClone-OdingaNarrative.mp3/original/4-Jan18-CallerSuggestsObamaIsAClone-OdingaNarrative.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527210542299_292421\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>It pains me to say \"let's ignore for now that this caller is suggesting that Obama is a clone,\" but there are bigger issues to deal with.</p><p>For years after this episode, up to current day in 2018, Alex Jones often makes vague references to Obama's cousin \"Odinga,\" who Obama supposedly advised on how to foment a race war with the goal of Odinga could securing power in Kenya. It's something so dumb that it's really never ranked in terms of being something to look into. I finally did, and to my great surprise, it's all a load of bullshit.</p><p>Alex is talking about Kenyan politician Raila Odinga, and most of what he is reporting as news comes from a \"<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kenya-connection/\" target=\"_blank\">grandma-style fear-based chain email</a>\" sent out by Celeste and Loren Davis, a couple of very much insane missionaries in Africa. In the email, they claim that Obama is a secret Muslim, he gave tons of money to help Raila Odinga sow social unrest, and that \"we are sure that whatever happens, he will use the same tactic, crying rigged election if he doesn\u2019t win and possibly cause a race war in America.\"</p><p>It's incredibly poorly written, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/02/chain-email/not-a-cent-from-unrelated-obama/\" target=\"_blank\">the basic facts are contradicted by actual evidence</a>, and when reached for comment about the email, Loren Davis claimed \"this was a personal letter 'never intended to be forwarded or sent out to the Web.'\" If you don't speak Race-Baiting Fuck Head language, this more or less translates to \"we didn't realize our name was on that and could be traced back to us.\"</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7176683.stm\" target=\"_blank\">2007 interview with the BBC</a>, Raila Odinga did claim to be related to Obama, but researchers have been able to find no familial link, and Obama's uncle has said that there is no relation. Mr. Odinga undoubtedly made this claim because he was in the middle of a hotly-contested election, and associating himself with Obama (then a very exciting politician on the rise) would give him political clout. This theory is strengthened by the fact that a few months earlier, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/27/world/20070928KENYA_index/s/20070928KENYA_slide1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kenyan politician Nicholas Owino Rajula made the exact same claim</a> of relation to Obama, but we don't hear Alex acting like this one was true. Probably because Alex mostly gets his news from lunatic missionary chain emails, and no one wrote one of those about Rajula.</p><p>Interestingly, most of the middle portion of this episode involves Alex getting super defensive about getting a call or two from people who feel like he is not really proving any of the things he's claiming. These callers are completely correct in their feelings, Alex is proving none of the things he's claiming, but as it turns out, Alex does not feel that \"proving things\" is his job:</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527264413300_28689\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"Jan. 18, 2009\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"33000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Proving Things Is Not Alex's Job\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5b08488088251b289f489f72/1527269505596/5-Jan18-ItsNotAlexJobToProveThings.mp3/original/5-Jan18-ItsNotAlexJobToProveThings.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527264413300_28756\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>I believe that the opposite is true, and that when a person makes outrageous claims, they are behooved to cite their evidence, and provide reasonable links or a bibliography so people can check up on their claims and evaluate them.

I suspect this may be because he got sent to a farm for an entire year during high school for fighting too much and then promptly dropped out of junior college and has since gotten most of his \"education\" and \"information\" from lore and patriot/militia themed blogs and message boards.</p><p>He either does not know how things work, or equally likely, he knows that his listeners have no idea how things work, and he knows he can use that against them.</p><p>The first thing is that a House Resolution, even if passed, cannot overturn an amendment to the constitution without going through the process to become an amendment itself. We've done this before in America, <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/prohibition-ends\" target=\"_blank\">when we had to undo the 18th Amendment</a> (which created prohibition) by passing the 21st Amendment (which got rid of prohibition). This is how amendments work, largely because once an amendment is passed, it is considered no longer just an amendment, but a part of the full Constitution.</p><p>If Alex does not understand that process, there is literally no reason to listen to anything he's saying, since this points to a dreadfully deficient awareness of our system of government.</p><p>The other problem is that HR 1022 was introduced in the 2007-2008 session of Congress, and has nothing to do with Obama. If Alex knows anything at all about this resolution past scary headlines he's read on blogs, then he has to know <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1022\" target=\"_blank\">that it was sent to subcommittee on March 19, 2007</a> and literally no action was taken on it and it died there without even having a vote. For some context, that dying in subcommittee happened 672 days before Alex got on air on Jan. 18, 2009 and tried to make his audience scared of this failed House Resolution by acting like it is current.</p><p>[Note: <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1022\" target=\"_blank\">HR 1022 in the 2009 session of Congress</a>, the next time that bill title would be used, was not a gun ban bill, it was about tightening laws regarding street gangs. It had nothing to do with gun regulation or registration, but even if it did, it too died in subcommittee without a vote. You would expect Alex to know these things.]</p><p>He does this a lot, most likely because his world-view is unsupported by facts and the real world, so in order to appear at all rational, his only choice is to manipulate and twist history in order to suit his purposes.</p><p><strong>2) Alex Used To Be Pro-Net Neutrality</strong></p>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527264413300_69446\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"Jan. 18, 2009\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"37000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Alex Is Pro-Net Neutrality\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5b085017352f533114097f2c/1527271448538/10-Jan18-CallerWhosHusbandIsInCable-AlexIsProNetNeutrality.mp3/original/10-Jan18-CallerWhosHusbandIsInCable-AlexIsProNetNeutrality.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527264413300_69511\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p>Not much to discuss from this, it's just a rational position for someone who works primarily as an online media purveyor.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* None. There are a few dumb callers though. One makes an argument that Obama is ineligible to be president, which is something that comes up way less than I would have expected on this show back in 2009.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nAlex is finally back from vacation, and he is gearing up emotionally for Barack Obama's impending inauguration. Alex is working overtime to maintain the illusion that he is a political non-partisan, while at the same time completely freaking out about how Obama is going to destroy the USA and bring in a fascist hell-scape.\r\n\r\nIt's a hard line for him to walk, and it falls apart almost immediately after the inauguration.\r\n\r\nFor now, though, Alex is satisfied to just do what he does best: lie about stuff.\r\n\r\nThe first big lie that Alex injects into the show is about how the &quot;Globalists,&quot; by way of David Rockefeller, just went to the boardrooms of all the oil companies that sell in America (that are all secretly still owned by the Rockefellers, who secretly never broke up Standard Oil, even though they did) and made a severe demand of them:\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of problems with the plot that Alex is laying out here. The first problem is that he is just making stuff up.\r\n\r\nI'm not particularly concerned about the BP and Shell issues he's bringing up, because that just seems like a bunch of nonsense. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/7802978/BP-its-10-biggest-shareholders.html BP's largest shareholder list]\u00a0doesn't include the Queen of England or the Netherlands. Royalty is really goofy though, so Alex could be right in some meaningless technicality kind of way. What I mean is that, technically, Queen Elizabeth owns all the land in England and Canada and everything in it. Functionally, she doesn't, but because royalty is a stupid system, she technically does.\r\n\r\nAs for Dutch Royal Shell, it does appear that Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands does have some stock in the company, [https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/26/0626queens.html#4bfd756b4270 but it appears to be quite a bit less than Alex is saying]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cMost of the wealth comes from the family\u2019s longstanding stake in the U.K. and Netherlands-based oil company, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group . At one time, the royals reportedly owned as much as 25% of the oil company; their stake is now estimated at a minimum of 2%, worth $2.7 billion\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\n\u2014 Forbes\r\n\r\nAt very least, Alex is engaging in really stupid over-simplification here. Where he really drifts into trouble though is as it relates to the Rockefeller family controlling all the oil companies that sell oil in America (other than Shell and BP, that is).\r\n\r\nThis is a crazy lie that doesn't stand up to even the most minimal investigation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, what are the 12 American oil companies that David Rockefeller allegedly shook down for carbon taxes? Once you get past the top 8 or so American oil companies, you are no longer dealing with giant companies, definitely not ones that would have a big say in implementing &quot;carbon taxes.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhat Alex wants the audience to think is that John D.\u00a0Rockefeller's Standard Oil never actually got broken up, and that the Rockefellers have secretly been running literally all non-Queen related oil in America since forever. This is not true, for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, the Supreme Court ruled that Standard Oil was an illegal monopoly, and it was busted up into companies that would become a bunch of other large oil companies: Chevron, ExxonMobil, Amoco, Texaco, and Marathon, most notably. This is what Alex hopes to misrepresent to his listeners, he wants them to be suspicious that all these companies come from the former monopoly company, Standard Oil, and of course it never really broke up. Why would the Rockefellers be so dumb as to really break up just because a pesky little think like the Supreme Court telling them they have to?\r\n\r\n[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/221/1/ Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States] did happen, and the end result was that [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Standard-Oil-Company-and-Trust Standard Oil was split up into 34 different competing companies], with separate board members, completely autonomous from each other. That is what history shows us, and if Alex can prove otherwise, he needs to do that, instead of just make vague accusations on air.\r\n\r\nThe further problem is, even beyond this historical revisionism, Alex just doesn't know what he's talking about. For instance, the second largest American oil company (when this episode came out. [https://www.statista.com/statistics/241625/top-10-us-oil-and-gas-companies-based-on-market-value/ They have since slipped down the list to #7]),\u00a0Valero Energy was founded in 1980 and [https://www.valero.com/en-us/AboutValero/CompanyHistory was never a part of Standard Oil or any Rockefeller business] (in fact, over the years, Valero has been the one buying up oil interests from former Standard Oil companies like Chevron or Exxon, not the other way around). Also, the fifth largest American oil company, Occidental Petroleum, [http://www.oxy.com/aboutOccidental/Pages/default.aspx also has nothing to do with Standard Oil] or the Rockefeller family. The fourth largest, EOG Resources, has nothing to do with Standard Oil, but does come from the ashes of Enron, so fuck them. The third largest, ConocoPhillips, came from a merger of two companies, Conoco and Phillips 66, neither of which came from Standard Oil (however, Phillips did merge their chemical division with Standard Oil remnant Chevron in 2000, but that's not what Alex is talking about).\r\n\r\nI know that's a lot, but the third, fourth, fifth, and seventh largest American oil companies have nothing to do with the companies left after the break up of Standard Oil. There is no way that David Rockefeller could assert ownership of them, which is something he couldn't do even with ExxonMobil or Chevron on the basis that came from Standard Oil. This is all an unsupported delusional fiction that Alex is spinning as proof that carbon taxes are evil and they're coming.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that this is very stupid, and Alex is praying that his listeners never look anything up.\r\n\r\nThe next big lie that Alex Jones engages in is to talk about Barack Obama's alleged cousin, &quot;Odinga:&quot;\r\n\r\nIt pains me to say &quot;let's ignore for now that this caller is suggesting that Obama is a clone,&quot; but there are bigger issues to deal with.\r\n\r\nFor years after this episode, up to current day in 2018, Alex Jones often makes vague references to Obama's cousin &quot;Odinga,&quot; who Obama supposedly advised on how to foment a race war with the goal of Odinga could securing power in Kenya. It's something so dumb that it's really never ranked in terms of being something to look into. I finally did, and to my great surprise, it's all a load of bullshit.\r\n\r\nAlex is talking about Kenyan politician Raila Odinga, and most of what he is reporting as news comes from a &quot;[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kenya-connection/ grandma-style fear-based chain email]&quot; sent out by Celeste and Loren Davis, a couple of very much insane missionaries in Africa. In the email, they claim that Obama is a secret Muslim, he gave tons of money to help Raila Odinga sow social unrest, and that &quot;we are sure that whatever happens, he will use the same tactic, crying rigged election if he doesn\u2019t win and possibly cause a race war in America.&quot;\r\n\r\nIt's incredibly poorly written, [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/02/chain-email/not-a-cent-from-unrelated-obama/ the basic facts are contradicted by actual evidence], and when reached for comment about the email, Loren Davis claimed &quot;this was a personal letter 'never intended to be forwarded or sent out to the Web.'&quot; If you don't speak Race-Baiting Fuck Head language, this more or less translates to &quot;we didn't realize our name was on that and could be traced back to us.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7176683.stm 2007 interview with the BBC], Raila Odinga did claim to be related to Obama, but researchers have been able to find no familial link, and Obama's uncle has said that there is no relation. Mr. Odinga undoubtedly made this claim because he was in the middle of a hotly-contested election, and associating himself with Obama (then a very exciting politician on the rise) would give him political clout. This theory is strengthened by the fact that a few months earlier, [https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/27/world/20070928KENYA_index/s/20070928KENYA_slide1.html Kenyan politician Nicholas Owino Rajula made the exact same claim] of relation to Obama, but we don't hear Alex acting like this one was true. Probably because Alex mostly gets his news from lunatic missionary chain emails, and no one wrote one of those about Rajula.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, most of the middle portion of this episode involves Alex getting super defensive about getting a call or two from people who feel like he is not really proving any of the things he's claiming. These callers are completely correct in their feelings, Alex is proving none of the things he's claiming, but as it turns out, Alex does not feel that &quot;proving things&quot; is his job:\r\n\r\nI believe that the opposite is true, and that when a person makes outrageous claims, they are behooved to cite their evidence, and provide reasonable links or a bibliography so people can check up on their claims and evaluate them. You don't get to pretend you're some arch truth-teller if you staunchly refuse to prove any of the things you say, and just instead insist that it's your audience's job to do the leg-work.\r\n\r\nAs Alex continues down this &quot;that's not my job&quot; line of thinking, he gets increasingly defensive about how right he always is:\r\n\r\nThis is particularly fun as a quote from this episode where, on top of all the little lies we've just ignored, we see two prime examples of complete falsehoods being pushed by Alex to serve his ideological interests.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe only other two things worth pointing out about this episode are as follows:\r\n\r\n'''1) Alex Freaks Out About A House Resolution'''\r\n\r\nThis is the beginning of a trend I'm starting to notice: Alex does not understand how the government works. I suspect this may be because he got sent to a farm for an entire year during high school for fighting too much and then promptly dropped out of junior college and has since gotten most of his &quot;education&quot; and &quot;information&quot; from lore and patriot/militia themed blogs and message boards.\r\n\r\nHe either does not know how things work, or equally likely, he knows that his listeners have no idea how things work, and he knows he can use that against them.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is that a House Resolution, even if passed, cannot overturn an amendment to the constitution without going through the process to become an amendment itself. We've done this before in America, [https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/prohibition-ends when we had to undo the 18th Amendment] (which created prohibition) by passing the 21st Amendment (which got rid of prohibition). This is how amendments work, largely because once an amendment is passed, it is considered no longer just an amendment, but a part of the full Constitution.\r\n\r\nIf Alex does not understand that process, there is literally no reason to listen to anything he's saying, since this points to a dreadfully deficient awareness of our system of government.\r\n\r\nThe other problem is that HR 1022 was introduced in the 2007-2008 session of Congress, and has nothing to do with Obama. If Alex knows anything at all about this resolution past scary headlines he's read on blogs, then he has to know [https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1022 that it was sent to subcommittee on March 19, 2007] and literally no action was taken on it and it died there without even having a vote. For some context, that dying in subcommittee happened 672 days before Alex got on air on Jan. 18, 2009 and tried to make his audience scared of this failed House Resolution by acting like it is current.\r\n\r\n[Note: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1022 HR 1022 in the 2009 session of Congress], the next time that bill title would be used, was not a gun ban bill, it was about tightening laws regarding street gangs. It had nothing to do with gun regulation or registration, but even if it did, it too died in subcommittee without a vote. You would expect Alex to know these things.]\r\n\r\nHe does this a lot, most likely because his world-view is unsupported by facts and the real world, so in order to appear at all rational, his only choice is to manipulate and twist history in order to suit his purposes.\r\n\r\n'''2) Alex Used To Be Pro-Net Neutrality'''\r\n\r\nNot much to discuss from this, it's just a rational position for someone who works primarily as an online media purveyor. The only thing that is interesting about this clip and makes it worth mentioning is that Alex Jones is currently very anti-Net Neutrality. Something happened that made him change his mind, much like his position on Israel/Palestine, and police brutality.\r\n\r\nCould the rise of the Tea Party have something to do with these pivots on pretty fundamental issues? Only time will tell.\r\n",

It is really funny that in the future, Alex pretends that he &quot;gave Obama a chance,&quot; when it is crystal clear that Alex was absolutely against Obama from the jump, and is actually already editing his &quot;documentary&quot; The Obama Deception in the evenings of January 2009.\r\n\r\nAlex is taking every opportunity to take a jab at Obama, including this deconstruction of a Newsweek cover he appeared on:\r\n\r\nIn this clip, Alex goes over a nefarious list of the world's elites. Generally at this point in history, Alex mostly just takes aim at the Rothschild and Rockefeller families. This is a longer list of elites, and includes the likes of Donald Trump's future Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, but mysteriously does not include George Soros. Alex doesn't point out that Soros is missing. Honestly, I only bring this up to mention that thus far in 2009, Alex has not brought up George Soros at all; he just does not seem to be on the radar as far as evil &quot;Globalists&quot; go, which seems weird. Real weird. Probably not a coincidence.\r\n\r\nAlex made most of his reputation and elevated his career on being the ringleader of 9/11 truth, which makes his response to a caller on this show particularly upsetting:\r\n\r\nIn the pantheon of really bad pieces of evidence that 9/11 was an inside job, this is one of the weakest, and the fact that Alex goes along with it, agrees with the caller, and very clearly indicates that he too believes that United Flight 93 landed safely at Hopkins Airport in Cleveland. It did not.\r\n\r\nLiz Foreman, the person whose name was on the story, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060613203349/http://blogs.scripps.com/wcpo/staff/2006/02/wcpocoms_flight_93_story.html has come out and explained what happened with the reporting]. The short version is that 9/11 was a pretty hectic day, and in the chaos, an AP story got posted on WCPO that erroneously claimed that Flight 93 had landed in Cleveland, which is not true. The plane that landed there was Delta Flight 1989, which was mistaken for United 93. Of course, the fact that Ms. Foreman has explained this error only serves as more proof of a cover-up to those who really want to believe.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Alex is so indiscriminating that he is willing to feed into and support this level of completely unrealistic nonsense should speak volumes. He is not a serious-minded person, and he gets most of his information from blogs and message boards, or worse from his callers.\r\n\r\nI can be fairly certain that he doesn't get his information from primary sources, and this clip helps me make that case:\r\n\r\nHere is the complete text of the 22nd Amendment:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cSection 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSection 2. This Article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\n\u2014 The United States Constitution\r\n\r\nNone of that has to do with &quot;a foreigner becoming president.&quot; It is only about term limits. The part about &quot;no foreigners being President,&quot; that wasn't an Amendment. That's just from the regular old Constitution, in Article 2, Section 5:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cNo Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nIt appears that Alex doesn't have much of a grasp on his favorite document of all time, the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe other thing he doesn't have a grasp on, which just keeps coming up, is civics and how the government works. The House cannot just pass a bill that would overturn an amendment in the Constitution, and then magically that amendment doesn't fly anymore. Courts would just strike down the bill as being unconstitutional, unless the bill achieved enough of a consensus that said bill became an amendment itself. This process is spelled out in [https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-v Article 5 of Alex's favorite document that he seems to know nothing about, the Constitution].\r\n\r\nIn order to overturn an amendment, you need a new amendment. This is why we have [https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/prohibition-ends the 21st amendment], which exists solely to undo the 18th amendment, which brought us prohibition. If the House wanted to pass a bill to undo the 22nd amendment, they would need to do the same thing: secure passage of the bill in both houses of Congress with a 2/3 majority, then have the bill ratified by 3/4 of the state legislatures in the country. That is the only way to undo an amendment to the Constitution, and Alex knows it. He knows damn well they can't just pass some bill in the House and use it as a precedent against a fucking amendment. That's abject lunacy.\r\n\r\nThe other lie that Alex is playing with here (there are a lot of them) is that he is saying that this bill is being pushed through the House &quot;at Obama's request,&quot; heavily implying that Obama wanted them to do this so he could stay in power past the limit of eight years.\r\n\r\nAlex never clarifies, but the bill he's talking about is House Joint Resolution 5, and like all the bills Alex tries to get his audience afraid of, it [https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-joint-resolution/5 died in subcommittee] without ever even getting a vote. And Alex should expect that to happen, because the person who proposed the resolution, Rep. Jose Serrano (D-NY) has introduced identical bill every two years since 1997, and each time, the bill has died in subcommittee. It happened in [https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-joint-resolution/4 2001], [https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-joint-resolution/11 2003], [https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-joint-resolution/9 2005], and [https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-joint-resolution/8 2007], all while George W. Bush was in office, so it doesn't appear that Serrano's actions were motivated by keeping the presidency within one party for a perpetual dictatorship. It appears that he really just didn't like term limits.\r\n\r\nLegitimately, when you start to see information like this, and you have a very basic understanding of how the government and world works, there are only two conclusions you can come to. Either, a) Alex Jones is a complete idiot who knows literally nothing about the things he's talking about, or b) Alex Jones knows damn well that he's lying, and he's banking on his audience's gullibility and ignorance to allow the scam to continue.\r\n\r\nMy gut tells me it's B.\r\n",

Alex believes that shit, and instead of do his own show on the day this guy is made the President, he dips out for a good half hour to talk to Russian state-owned media, handing them a nice little video they got to put out with the headline \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxzjkbrZxxU&amp;t=197s\" target=\"_blank\">People Are Going To Hate Obama</a>.\"</p><p>It's a surreal thing, mostly because it is woefully transparent.

He uses the term in a very specific way, and has for years.</p><p>When someone in the House uses the term, generally, they mean something completely different.

If he doesn't, then he has no business reporting on the matter, and is unintentionally misleading people who understandably have a trained response to hearing Alex say the words \"martial law.\" If he does know the difference, and he doesn't explain what he means to his listeners, he is being manipulative on a level that borders on criminally irresponsible.</p><p>Interestingly, \"martial law\" happens in Congress way more than you'd think, because all it means in the Congressional context is that one side knows they have the votes they need, or everyone wants to go on vacation, so they want to waive the rules where you have to wait three days after introducing a bill to vote on it.

His statement about moving his show off network included the following: &quot;GCN is a reflection of Alex Jones' views of the world, and more and more our points of view regarding Israel are diverging..I guess the breaking point was his rant in which he said that anyone who is a critic of Israel is a &quot;weak-minded fool.&quot;\r\n* '''Ron Paul''': Ron Paul was a member of the House of Representatives from Texas from 1976-77, 1979-85, and 1997-2013. He has run for the republican presidential nomination a bunch of times, but never got it. He's only the second Libertarian to receive an electoral vote, but only because some dumbass faithless elector in Texas voted for him in the 2016 election, which he was not even in. His political ideas are absurd, [http://www.mrdestructo.com/2011/12/game-over-scans-of-over-50-ron-paul.html he very clearly has a deep history of racism]\u00a0as well as homophobia, among other bigotries (check out the [https://italkyoubored.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/the-ron-paul-newsletter-story-that-i-found-the-most-disturbing-blast-em/ Oct. 1992 issue of his newsletter] for tips on how to get away with murdering a black youth!), but most importantly, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_a_Sound_Economy he was the first chairman of the Koch brothers' funded Citizens for A Sound Economy]\u00a0in 1984, which eventually split into Americans For Prosperity and FreedomWorks, two fronts with which the Kochs funded and manufactured the Tea Party, which idolized Ron Paul's dumb ideas. He pretends to be the outsider, when he's been in with the Kochs for at least 34 years.\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nThis should have been Alex's best show ever, and in short, it was not.\r\n\r\nHere it was, the day of Barack Obama's inauguration as President, this needed to be the day that Alex gives the performance of his life. He needed to be pulling out fake tears, he needed to have actual information at his disposal, he needed to create something real.\r\n\r\nHe didn't do any of that, but what he did do is completely fascinating and confusing to reflect on now:\r\n\r\n'''1) Alex Spends A Lot Of Time On The Show Singing Along With Country Music'''\r\n\r\nThis is not even counting when he sings Folsom Prison Blues at the show's four hour mark, which bummed me out too much to cut out as a clip.\r\n\r\nFor someone deeply concerned about how a literal demon, who is the front-man for a Global syndicate that is out to destroy the world and enslave everyone, who may also be the literal Christian anti-Christ, is being made President of the United States, Alex seems fairly breezy, at least as long as those smooth country jams are kicking.\r\n\r\n'''2) Alex Leaves His Own Show To Appear On Russia Today'''\r\n\r\nI have been listening to Alex Jones episodes, taking notes on them, and researching his rhetoric every day for the last 18 months. In that time, I have listened to hundreds and hundreds of episodes of his show. In all of the episodes I have ever heard, I have not once heard him leave his own broadcast to do something else.\r\n\r\nThis turn of event is truly unbelievable.\r\n\r\nAlex Jones presents himself, even in 2009, as the figurehead of some kind of movement of patriots. It is a movement against &quot;Globalists&quot; and &quot;bankers&quot; who the movement believes are pushing toward a depopulation agenda, and Barack Obama is the fake savior they've chosen to use to usher in the final stage of it, wherein all the patriots get killed and humanity is doomed. Alex believes that shit, and instead of do his own show on the day this guy is made the President, he dips out for a good half hour to talk to Russian state-owned media, handing them a nice little video they got to put out with the headline &quot;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxzjkbrZxxU&t=197s People Are Going To Hate Obama].&quot;\r\n\r\nIt's a surreal thing, mostly because it is woefully transparent. Alex loves going on RT because they are the only network that will allow him on air and treat him like he's not a complete idiot. They love having Alex on because he says stupid shit that makes America look like the bad guys in every situation and his rhetoric fits perfectly into their world-view, where international cooperation is secretly evil. He's the perfect Russian propagandist, and they didn't even need to cultivate him as an asset, they just had to tell their anchors to resist the urge to tell him to shut up.\r\n\r\nThere may be more to the story here, but you cannot convince me that it is not meaningful that Alex Jones left his own show in complete disarray (the guest host filling in for him was calling in from Hawaii, and spent most of his time on air trying to sort out tech issues), on the day of his enemy's ascendance, because Russia wanted to talk to him. It's nuts.\r\n\r\n'''3) We Get An Update On Alex's Mission To Sell His Broken Bullhorn'''\r\n\r\nIt's always fun when self-professed alpha men complain about being the victim of super soft &quot;crimes,&quot; which don't even really sound believable. There is no world wherein I am going to believe that someone called Alex and said, &quot;you son of a bitch, there's no way I'm gonna let you sell that bullhorn.&quot; That just absolutely did not happen.\r\n\r\nAll of this is Alex's way of rationalizing to himself that he is about to do his second Moneybomb in as many years. He is presenting it as a thing where he's only doing a Moneybomb because these villains came and ruined his Broken Bullhorn Sale, so now his back is to the wall. The only problem with this, is that at this point, he'd been talking for weeks about how they were going to do a Moneybomb. This is not a new development.\r\n\r\n'''4) Alex Reports That We Are Now In Martial Law'''\r\n\r\n&quot;Congress has been openly told they're under martial law.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis quote is a doozy, since Alex just throws it out there with no context, and no real way to get to the bottom of what he's talking about. He wants his audience to think that this is something that is happening right now, to give the appearance of immediacy, that Obama is moving fast. He's been in office 35 minutes and already Congress is under martial law?\r\n\r\nIn reality, this is just Alex rehashing one of his old narratives, from an article he posted on InfoWars on Sept. 28, 2008, which was actually just a complete copy-and-paste job from [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120032349/http://dailynewscaster.com/2008/09/28/rep-michael-burgess-we-are-under-martial-law/ an article he lifted from Daily News Caster], a conspiracy theory blog that is no longer in operation.\r\n\r\nThat article, from three months prior, claims that Representative Michael Burgess (TX-R) gave a one minute speech in opposition to bailing out any of the banks, in which he said &quot;Mr. Speaker I understand we are under Martial Law as declared by the speaker last night.&quot; It's true, he did say that. But, if you read [https://books.google.com/books?id=ascxLrgnlUkC&pg=PA22901&lpg=PA22901&dq=Mr.+Speaker+I+understand+we+are+under+Martial+Law+as+declared+by+the+speaker+last+night.&source=bl&ots=pGeUpRpo8J&sig=CRBxF_jQBPlKXFtDKXC2PmS5zKA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG_PuC0aLbAhXrHzQIHVvuBSoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Mr.%20Speaker%20I%20understand%20we%20are%20under%20Martial%20Law%20as%20declared%20by%20the%20speaker%20last%20night.&f=false the Congressional record from that day], and see the context in which he's speaking, it's pretty clear he doesn't mean the same thing by &quot;martial law&quot; that Alex does.\r\n\r\nAlex Jones uses the term &quot;martial law&quot; to describe a state of tyranny, where the military is out in black helicopters and tanks, oppressing the people of America. &quot;Martial law&quot; to Alex Jones is when there are curfews and check-points, and the man has come and taken your guns so you can't fight back. He uses the term in a very specific way, and has for years.\r\n\r\nWhen someone in the House uses the term, generally, they mean something completely different. It's like how when they talk about &quot;the Nuclear Option,&quot; they aren't literally talking about dropping a Hydrogen Bomb on the Senate. Politicians can use metaphor too.\r\n\r\nAlex either understands that these are different things, or he doesn't. If he doesn't, then he has no business reporting on the matter, and is unintentionally misleading people who understandably have a trained response to hearing Alex say the words &quot;martial law.&quot; If he does know the difference, and he doesn't explain what he means to his listeners, he is being manipulative on a level that borders on criminally irresponsible.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, &quot;martial law&quot; happens in Congress way more than you'd think, because all it means in the Congressional context is that one side knows they have the votes they need, or everyone wants to go on vacation, so they want to waive the rules where you have to wait three days after introducing a bill to vote on it. It's not even something that is considered all that severe;\u00a0[http://archives-democrats-rules.house.gov/113/briefing/Rules_Committee_101_Handout.pdf it's even in the Congressional rule book].\r\n\r\nIt happens a lot. For instance, consider this Politico article from July 27, 2017 where they discuss [https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/27/house-members-directed-to-delay-recess-departure-for-obamacare-repeal-241045 Republican politicians wanting to use the &quot;martial law rule&quot; so they could repeal Obamacare and still make it to their August vacations]:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cHouse Republicans leaders are instructing lawmakers to hold off leaving for August recess this weekend in case the Senate passes Obamacare repeal legislation and the House comes under pressure to act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn an email to lawmakers Thursday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), raised the possibility that they might need to take votes in the coming days if the Senate approves a health care bill. House Republicans are also gearing up to waive chamber rules mandating they wait three days after a bill is made public to vote on the legislation on the floor, what\u2019s known as \u201cmartial law\u201d in the House.\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nWeirdly, Alex didn't seem to be all that interested in creating fear in his audience about &quot;Congress being under martial law&quot; when Trump was in office, and the bill they were trying to push through was something he supported. Super weird.\r\n\r\nAlso, just a fun aside about Rep. Michael Burgess, the source of this disingenuous martial law bullshit. He was one of the early adopters of the Tea Party, and [https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00025219&cycle=2008&type=C in his election cycle in 2008, his #1 donor was, you guessed it, Koch Industries], with support to the tune of $20,000. Weird how they keep popping up.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the rest of this show is mostly bad call-ins from listeners that don't really merit discussion.\r\n\r\nJust to make things entirely clear about Alex's views on Obama, on the day of his first inauguration, here is a pretty succinct synopsis:\r\n",

Then, every time he's on, in order to make his ad revenue, Alex Jones has to set up Marty to tell a dirty limerick on air that has nothing to do with anything, and often is not even technically a limerick. I love this so much, as it demonstrates clearly how desperate Alex was for money in 2009. He was <a href=\"https://knowledgefight.com/business/2018/4/11/alex-jones-used-to-accept-ad-money-from-a-cult\" target=\"_blank\">accepting ad money from a cult</a>, and he let an old man tell dirty poems on air.

He alleges that he used to plant drugs on people to set them up for convictions, but after getting high and exploring hallucinogens, he realized that there was a better way in life. It's a good story, but I don't believe any of it, except that he probably was a cop. Barry has for many years hosted <a href=\"https://nevergetbusted.com/how-to-pass-a-drug-test/\" target=\"_blank\">a website where he gives people advice about how to cheat a drug test</a>, which (assuming his advice is accurate) is pretty cool. Since his 2009 appearance on Alex's show, he's begun offering <a href=\"https://triptowellness.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Ibogaine and Ayahuasca \"retreats\" in Mexico</a>, with promises of a quick fix for addiction (not to mention all the mental illnesses that magically get cured). The science is pretty unclear currently, but it looks like these intervention methods are really only effective for cessation, <a href=\"https://americanaddictioncenters.org/meth-treatment/success-rate-for-ibogaine/\" target=\"_blank\">not for keeping people sober</a>. Patients who do not enter therapy or join a recovery group after the Ibogaine interrupts their process of addiction show relapse rates as high as 90%, according to some experts. These retreats are possibly helpful to start a life-long process of recovery, but Barry is not selling them that way, which leads me to believe he's a con-man, fleecing vulnerable addicts who are desperate for a way out. The fact that prices \"start\" at just under $5,000 for the retreat, and <a href=\"https://triptowellness.net/itinerary-and-what-to-expect/\" target=\"_blank\">that price doesn't include travel, hotel, or food</a> doesn't help. Bottom line, this is not a man I want to trust with my vulnerable mental health issues. I feel that point is well illustrated by this clip from his appearance, where he explains that he would replace sex ed in schools with a class that teaches girls to be \"less jealous,\" which turns out to just be a way for Barry to vent about his ex-wife:</li></ul>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block audio-block sqs-block-audio\" data-block-type=\"41\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527361392292_38082\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\">\n<div class=\"sqs-audio-embed\" data-author=\"Jan. 21, 2009\" data-color-theme=\"dark\" data-design-style=\"minimal\" data-duration-in-ms=\"69000\" data-mime-type=\"\" data-show-download=\"false\" data-title=\"Barry Cooper Is Mad At His Ex-Wife\" data-url=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/t/5b09b5616d2a73781cfc51c1/1527362914251/21-BarrCooperWantsToVentAboutHisExWife.mp3/original/21-BarrCooperWantsToVentAboutHisExWife.mp3\">\n</div>\n</div></div><div class=\"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1527361392292_38147\"><div class=\"sqs-block-content\"><p><em><strong>Narratives</strong></em>:\u00a0</p><p>This episode is a Tale Of Two Cities.

It just means that they are moving to waive the three day waiting period that's usually required between proposing a bill and voting on it. It has nothing to do with the \"InfoWars definition\" of martial law, which is less about impatience and more about a police state.</p><p>To support his narrative about Congress, Alex brings in the \"<a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg555.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">War Powers Act</a>,\" which is profoundly weird. It's so completely unrelated to the things he's talking about that I sincerely am starting to question whether or not he is just speaking completely randomly, like some kind of paranoid, militia themed MadLibs (possible name for such a product: Super Mad At Libs).</p><p>The War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973, and was largely a response to the shit-show that was the Vietnam War. 58,000+ Americans were killed and over 300,000 wounded, 200,000-400,000 South Vietnamese dead, in a war that was ultimately pointless. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\">War was never declared in Vietnam, nor in Korea</a>, nor later in the Persian Gulf; these were just called \"military actions,\" or some other euphemism to get around the fact that according to the Constitution, the President can't just declare a war, but instead has to go to Congress, which has the ultimate authority to go to war.</p><p>The War Powers Resolution was an attempt to make sure something like the Vietnam War never happened again, and that cooler heads would prevail to keep the US from engaging in wars they have no business in. It was a failed attempt, but that is clearly the spirit of the Resolution, as it seeks to lay out a time-table wherein the President's power to introduce US troops into hostilities would be checked by having to report to Congress within 48 hours, and then repeatedly afterwards to justify the continued troop presence.</p><p>This system has been abused by many Presidents and many Congresses, but on it's face, this Resolution was an attempt to solve a very serious problem. It failed, but that should be considered a corruption and human failing, not a sign that the Resolution is meant to make more war.</p><p>The bigger point, though is that the War Powers Resolution literally has nothing to do with the \"martial law rule\" in the House, nor does it have anything to do with the federal bailout of the banks that is the root of the Congressional martial law narrative that Alex is talking about in the first place.</p><p>It's very clear what Alex is trying to make his audience think here, which is where I have to abandon my \"he's just saying random words\" theory. Here is a little construction of how he wants his audience to understand what he's saying:</p><ol><li>They are desperate to pass this bank bailout bill, because it is how they will fund the New World Order, and will allow them to be able to afford to oppress everyone</li><li>They can't get the bailout bill through Congress unless they use force to do it, so they have put Congress under martial law</li><li>\"Martial law\" is a state of emergency, which is listed in the War Powers Act as a reason for the President to be able to call in the military as his jack-booted thugs: \"The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to...\u00a0a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.\"</li><li>Therefore, in order to force through their bank bailout bill, the \"Globalists\" are positioning a situation where Obama can call in the military to kill all the patriots (or just fill in the blank conclusion with whatever paranoid fantasy scenario you like best).</li></ol><p>This may not be exactly what he's going for, but I assure you, it is something close to this, and it's all bullshit. He's misreading every primary source, he's lying about what \"Congressional martial law\" means, and he's making insane logical leaps that are completely unsupported by fact or solid inference. I apologize that this has gotten so long already, but it is crucially important to understand that this is the level of thinking that is behind almost all of the things that Alex Jones says.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* '''Marty Shackter''': Marty is the owner of one of Alex's primary sponsors, Cal-Ben Soaps. Once a month or so, as part of his sponsorship contract, Alex has to let Marty come on the show and talk about how no other soap is really soap. Then, every time he's on, in order to make his ad revenue, Alex Jones has to set up Marty to tell a dirty limerick on air that has nothing to do with anything, and often is not even technically a limerick. I love this so much, as it demonstrates clearly how desperate Alex was for money in 2009. He was [https://knowledgefight.com/business/2018/4/11/alex-jones-used-to-accept-ad-money-from-a-cult accepting ad money from a cult], and he let an old man tell dirty poems on air. Here is the &quot;limerick&quot; from this episode:\r\n\r\n* '''Barry Cooper''': Barry Cooper is a retired police officer. He alleges that he used to plant drugs on people to set them up for convictions, but after getting high and exploring hallucinogens, he realized that there was a better way in life. It's a good story, but I don't believe any of it, except that he probably was a cop. Barry has for many years hosted [https://nevergetbusted.com/how-to-pass-a-drug-test/ a website where he gives people advice about how to cheat a drug test], which (assuming his advice is accurate) is pretty cool. Since his 2009 appearance on Alex's show, he's begun offering [https://triptowellness.net/ Ibogaine and Ayahuasca &quot;retreats&quot; in Mexico], with promises of a quick fix for addiction (not to mention all the mental illnesses that magically get cured). The science is pretty unclear currently, but it looks like these intervention methods are really only effective for cessation, [https://americanaddictioncenters.org/meth-treatment/success-rate-for-ibogaine/ not for keeping people sober]. Patients who do not enter therapy or join a recovery group after the Ibogaine interrupts their process of addiction show relapse rates as high as 90%, according to some experts. These retreats are possibly helpful to start a life-long process of recovery, but Barry is not selling them that way, which leads me to believe he's a con-man, fleecing vulnerable addicts who are desperate for a way out. The fact that prices &quot;start&quot; at just under $5,000 for the retreat, and [https://triptowellness.net/itinerary-and-what-to-expect/ that price doesn't include travel, hotel, or food] doesn't help. Bottom line, this is not a man I want to trust with my vulnerable mental health issues. I feel that point is well illustrated by this clip from his appearance, where he explains that he would replace sex ed in schools with a class that teaches girls to be &quot;less jealous,&quot; which turns out to just be a way for Barry to vent about his ex-wife:\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis episode is a Tale Of Two Cities. On the one side, you have the two completely insane guest appearances mentioned above, and on the other, you have Alex spending about 80 minutes &quot;deconstructing&quot; Obama's inauguration speech from the day prior. He could have &quot;deconstructed&quot; it yesterday, but if you'll recall, he was too busy leaving his own show to be interviewed on Russia Today.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other notable moments to discuss that don't fall into one of those baskets, the most interesting being Alex again insisting that &quot;Congress is under martial law,&quot; but on this episode, he expands on that a little more:\r\n\r\n[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2009/1/20/january-20-2009 In the breakdown of yesterday's episode], I explained the manipulation Alex is using about the varying definitions of &quot;martial law,&quot; and how that doesn't mean what he is pretending it means when the term is used in relation to Congress. It just means that they are moving to waive the three day waiting period that's usually required between proposing a bill and voting on it. It has nothing to do with the &quot;InfoWars definition&quot; of martial law, which is less about impatience and more about a police state.\r\n\r\nTo support his narrative about Congress, Alex brings in the &quot;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg555.pdf War Powers Act],&quot; which is profoundly weird. It's so completely unrelated to the things he's talking about that I sincerely am starting to question whether or not he is just speaking completely randomly, like some kind of paranoid, militia themed MadLibs (possible name for such a product: Super Mad At Libs).\r\n\r\nThe War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973, and was largely a response to the shit-show that was the Vietnam War. 58,000+ Americans were killed and over 300,000 wounded, 200,000-400,000 South Vietnamese dead, in a war that was ultimately pointless. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States War was never declared in Vietnam, nor in Korea], nor later in the Persian Gulf; these were just called &quot;military actions,&quot; or some other euphemism to get around the fact that according to the Constitution, the President can't just declare a war, but instead has to go to Congress, which has the ultimate authority to go to war.\r\n\r\nThe War Powers Resolution was an attempt to make sure something like the Vietnam War never happened again, and that cooler heads would prevail to keep the US from engaging in wars they have no business in. It was a failed attempt, but that is clearly the spirit of the Resolution, as it seeks to lay out a time-table wherein the President's power to introduce US troops into hostilities would be checked by having to report to Congress within 48 hours, and then repeatedly afterwards to justify the continued troop presence.\r\n\r\nThis system has been abused by many Presidents and many Congresses, but on it's face, this Resolution was an attempt to solve a very serious problem. It failed, but that should be considered a corruption and human failing, not a sign that the Resolution is meant to make more war.\r\n\r\nThe bigger point, though is that the War Powers Resolution literally has nothing to do with the &quot;martial law rule&quot; in the House, nor does it have anything to do with the federal bailout of the banks that is the root of the Congressional martial law narrative that Alex is talking about in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt's very clear what Alex is trying to make his audience think here, which is where I have to abandon my &quot;he's just saying random words&quot; theory. Here is a little construction of how he wants his audience to understand what he's saying:\r\n\r\n# They are desperate to pass this bank bailout bill, because it is how they will fund the New World Order, and will allow them to be able to afford to oppress everyone\r\n# They can't get the bailout bill through Congress unless they use force to do it, so they have put Congress under martial law\r\n# &quot;Martial law&quot; is a state of emergency, which is listed in the War Powers Act as a reason for the President to be able to call in the military as his jack-booted thugs: &quot;The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to...\u00a0a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.&quot;\r\n# Therefore, in order to force through their bank bailout bill, the &quot;Globalists&quot; are positioning a situation where Obama can call in the military to kill all the patriots (or just fill in the blank conclusion with whatever paranoid fantasy scenario you like best).\r\n\r\nThis may not be exactly what he's going for, but I assure you, it is something close to this, and it's all bullshit. He's misreading every primary source, he's lying about what &quot;Congressional martial law&quot; means, and he's making insane logical leaps that are completely unsupported by fact or solid inference. I apologize that this has gotten so long already, but it is crucially important to understand that this is the level of thinking that is behind almost all of the things that Alex Jones says. Generally speaking, nothing he says means anything.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of saying things and meaning nothing, the entirety of Alex's &quot;deconstruction&quot; of Obama's inauguration speech is completely skippable. It is a classically Alex Jonesian performance, where he does the same thing he does every time he is forced to analyze something where he can't just lie about the primary source: he just hinges on single words or phrases and launches into petty, vague critiques about them, so as to chop up the speech into such a disjointed thing that no little piece can be taken in the context Obama meant it in. Here is but one example of that technique:\r\n\r\nHere, Alex just hears Obama mention a &quot;new age,&quot; so he cuts off the clip and goes off about it being &quot;New World Order Talk:&quot;\r\n\r\nFor the side that acts like they're all about free speech and can't stand &quot;language policing,&quot; the Alex Joneses of the world sure are triggered by a lot of innocuous terms.\r\n\r\nIn this clip, you can see Alex taking Obama being a generally gracious human and thanking Bush for his service into somehow being proof that...the collapse is coming?\r\n\r\nOne has to wonder what Alex would have preferred Obama do in that situation. Should he have just ignored that the former President was there? Should he have spit on the Bush family? There is no action that Obama could have taken in this situation that Alex would have not turned into some indication that he's been right all along, Obama is an evil front-man, and the shit is about to hit the fan.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of all that this half of the episode is.

When Alex Jones was on the show, <a href=\"http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-joe-rogan-appearance\" target=\"_blank\">Rogan allowed Alex to lie to his audience repeatedly</a> about very serious topics. When Rogan had Alex's economist friend Peter Schiff on, Rogan allowed Schiff to spread narratives about how everyone needs to buy gold because the dollar is going to collapse, only to reveal at the end of the show that he himself sells gold. This isn't even taking into account all of the horribly inaccurate and irresponsible shit he's allowed people like Milo, Ben Shapiro, Sam Harris, and many others to disseminate to his audience, seemingly lacking the ability or interest in debating their rhetoric.

    "citations_mediawiki": "'''''Guests''''':\r\n\r\n* '''Joe Rogan''': Joe Rogan is a comedian, actor and MMA enthusiast who hosts one of the biggest podcasts in the world. While his show originally was an entertaining blend of testosterone, conspiracy dabbling, and pseudo-spirituality, it has shifted over the years to becoming a platform for malicious entities to soft-peddle awful rhetoric, more or less unquestioned. When Alex Jones was on the show, [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-joe-rogan-appearance Rogan allowed Alex to lie to his audience repeatedly] about very serious topics. When Rogan had Alex's economist friend Peter Schiff on, Rogan allowed Schiff to spread narratives about how everyone needs to buy gold because the dollar is going to collapse, only to reveal at the end of the show that he himself sells gold. This isn't even taking into account all of the horribly inaccurate and irresponsible shit he's allowed people like Milo, Ben Shapiro, Sam Harris, and many others to disseminate to his audience, seemingly lacking the ability or interest in debating their rhetoric. What I'm getting at is that Rogan is cool and fun, but he may not be as sharp of a critical thinker as he presents himself to be.\r\n* '''Art Acevedo''': Art Acevedo was, at the time, the Austin Chief of Police. He appears on InfoWars from time to time because he believes in community outreach, and in being accessible as a leader of the department. He and Alex enjoy a bit of a jocular relationship, with Acevedo doing mildly insulting but good-natured impressions of Alex to his face. His appearances are generally pleasant, but they're mostly just Alex asking if Acevedo has heard about various stories Alex read on WND or Zero Hedge, and Acevedo saying &quot;no.&quot;\r\n\r\n'''''Narratives''''':\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting turning point that we can see starting to take shape on this episode of the show, namely that Alex Jones is starting to see the beginnings of what will become the Tea Party, and he realizes that he is not on the team.\r\n\r\nAlex is beginning to see his own worldview being imitated by Glenn Beck, and he's seeing his &quot;good buddy&quot; Ron Paul appearing on Beck's show, and it is starting to confuse him:\r\n\r\nIn reality, this should be the least confusing thing imaginable.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Ron Paul was made the first chairman of Citizens For A Sound Economy, a think tank entirely funded by Charles and David Koch.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Ron Paul ran for the Republican primary. He came up real short, coming in 4th behind John McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Mitt Romney. To Paul's credit, he beat the shit out of Rudy Guliani, who ended up with a respectable zero delegates.\r\n\r\nRon Paul officially lost the nomination on June 12, 2008, and shortly after, the first public flickers of the Tea Party began to pop up in the wake of Paul's failed campaign, with [http://www.mndaily.com/article/2008/09/ron-paul-supporters-rally-target-center Paul kicking off his &quot;Campaign For Liberty&quot; on Sept. 2, 2008 at a rally] he was holding on that date specifically because he was not invited to speak at the Republican National Convention, happening Sept. 1-4, 2008 and Ron Paul is apparently petty as fuck.\r\n\r\nAfter this, chatter swirled that he would run on the Libertarian ticket or with the Constitution Party, but in the end, he endorsed Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party. Chuck, by the way, is a really fucked up Christian Fundamentalist who [https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/chuck-baldwin holds such positions] as &quot;the Zionists run the media,&quot; &quot;homosexuality is a moral perversion,&quot; and (this is a direct quote) &quot;I believe the South was right in the War Between the States, and I am not a racist.&quot; I'm relieved to hear that he's not a racist.\r\n\r\nRon Paul embodied the philosophy that really works out well for corporate monsters, but it turns out that in practice, people just don't really like him enough to vote for him when there are other options on the table. He ended up with only 5.6% of the popular vote in the 2008 primary. Really think about that; that is about 1/4 of what 3rd place finisher Huckabee ended up with. Ron Paul is not, and has never been, all that popular.\r\n\r\nThe entire time after the 2008 election, it was completely obvious that Ron Paul was going to run again, so the struggle for the extreme right became &quot;how do we find any votes for this guy who is not all that popular?&quot; Enter the Tea Party.\r\n\r\nIn her book [https://books.google.com/books?id=GDf4DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=tea+party+all+chiefs+no+indians&source=bl&ots=4alDldq0R8&sig=DvVkbHN2VIVg2WYwsvhpfONTEck&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiv-YLy1KTbAhXIFjQIHRZRAJcQ6AEIbDAN#v=onepage&q=tea%20party%20all%20chiefs%20no%20indians&f=false Dark Money], Jane Meyer quotes economist Bruce Bartlett:\u00a0\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cThe problem with the whole Libertarian movement is that it\u2019s been all chiefs and no Indians. There weren\u2019t any actual people, like voters, who gave a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been trying to create an actual movement.\r\n\u201d</blockquote>\r\nThe Tea Party was the most successful attempt at creating a movement, and the Kochs did it through spending loads of money on conservative radio personalities like Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, and Mark Levin, [https://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/tea-party-radio-network-105774 funneling their money through organizations like FreedomWorks], filling in advertising losses caused by groups like the Heritage Foundation ceasing their support around this time.\r\n\r\nThe Tea Party grew, and did so largely because of the financial backing and co-opting of the movement by conservative billionaires, most importantly, the Kochs.\r\n\r\nTo get back to the point, Alex is beginning to see the roots of this movement happening, and he is realizing that he is on the outside looking in.

Also, it turns out that the people who made Ron Paul the first chairman of their think tank 25 years prior are the same people who were in 2009 paying Glenn Beck millions.\r\n\r\nThe picture is far more complicated than this, and it's very likely that the Tea Party and trying to create an artificial movement against taxes has been something that has been in the works with the Kochs for years.
