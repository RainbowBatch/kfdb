On this episode, Alex Jones makes a huge mistake and welcomes David Duke onto his show for an interview. Their exchange makes very apparent that the two men have almost no difference in their philosophies, and that Alex's world-view is largely just classical antisemitism with different labels."

The reason that Alex and his guests get to feign credibility is because they speak about things like Mars Colonies very non-specifically. But what happens when you take one of their non-specific claims and pay close attention to it? In this case, you end up learning a whole lot about a super soldier/Mars warrior."

This segment has very little to do with Trump, but is a nicely encapsulated tale of Alex being very stupid about race, getting his comeuppance, and completely ignoring being shown to be wrong.    Also, Dan complains about that Bon Iver/Alex Jones meme."

In this episode, Dan tries to cover way too long a stretch of time, in order to get to the end of Alex's 2015 Money Bomb, conveniently scheduled a few weeks before the end of the fiscal year.    There's a lot to cover, but thankfully Dan and Jordan have each other, and a guest appearance from their old friend, Red Wine, to help the medicine go down."

In this leg of the hunt, nothing really changes about Alex's feelings about Trump, but he does seem to throw a considerable amount of his weight behind another nationalist strongman, namely Putin. This leads Dan into a sea of rampant speculation."

He briefly touches on the nonsense Alex has been selling about Seth Rich, but most of the episode has to do with a deeply, deeply troubling interview Alex conducts on the Friday installment of his show, where he disseminates pro-Putin propaganda."

Not surprisingly, Alex's take on the whole situation, and who he thinks the bad actors in the whole thing, are not what you might hope, but they're probably what you'd expect.

Are they really space travelers, or is Mark a very serious con-man who has a lot of fanciful stories about Space Raptors? Most likely that second option."

Not only does Alex Jones gloss over the CIA torture report, but he also has two of the weirdest guests on the show imaginable: Prof. Darrell Hamamoto (Dan's ""favorite crazy"") and Billy Corgan (singer, mad at Anderson Cooper)."

This episode marks the first time we know of that Alex ends his show on a cliffhanger, but definitely not the first time he's spewed intensely ahistorical racist theories or used absurd arguments to defend horrible men."

The episode will live in all our memories as ""that time Alex Jones tried to pretend he wanted dissenters to call in, then avoided the minimal valid criticism a caller threw his way and started to fake crying talking about masculinity."" Also, Jordan screams about the tax bill."

It takes Alex about 45 min of showtime to get through less than a minute of content, and boy, his analysis of it all is weak.    Also, Alex admits that he started an entirely new sales website so he could skirt pricing agreements that he's signed with suppliers."

The gents try to figure out why they are still trying to solve a solved mystery, and in the process end up unpacking some crazy lies that Alex is trying to tell about the Chinese and the citizens of Michigan.    Also, Dan goes off on Ted Malloch out of nowhere."

Dan set out to find out what Alex thought of Russia when they first invaded Ukraine, and he found something unsettling. However, he also found a bizarre esoteric rant and an entire episode full of Alex treating his callers like assholes."
114,"December 31, 2017","January 27, 2013","January 27, 2013",Piers Morgan Interview,,Piers Morgan,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan discuss Alex Jones' very combative appearance with Piers Morgan from back in January of 2013. Both men are assholes, so just sit back and enjoy the last episode of 2017 as your hosts actively root against both participants in a ""debate."""

Folks may have expected Alex to turn over a new leaf in the new year and maybe stop lying so much. Those folks would be wrong. However, Alex does start 2018 with a bunch of ridiculous impressions, so we will call that a win."

The internet is up in arms about how Alex spent about 10 min of this episode screaming about Brian Stelter and demons, but did commentators miss an important element of the story? Probably."

Alex is concerned that the conspiracy world has left him behind, so he commits to a terrible narrative that is so absurd and stupid that Dan and Jordan can't stop laughing."

Unfortunately, it appears that Alex had no take on that, so Dan instead tells Jordan about the day where Alex goes real deep into board games and welcomes the most unlikely guest of all time onto the show."

This episode was broadcast the day after LaVoy Finnecum was killed at the Oregon Wildlife Preserve Standoff. That event has put Alex Jones into the kind of headspace where he accidentally says a number of things that he usually keeps inside, and luckily, Knowledge Fight is here to bring those things to light."
121,"January 23, 2018","April 1, 2013","April 2, 2013",Time Travel,,Steve Pieczenik; Susan Collins; Alexander Haig; Davey Crockett; Andrew Jackson,,,,,"Today, Dan tells Jordan all about an episode of The Alex Jones Show where Alex Jones keeps retelling a story about running into an ""authoritarian"" in a hot tub while on vacation. The story cannot be true, but it's fun to watch Alex give it more and more layers of lies as time goes on. Also, Alex lies a bunch about the UN to scare his listeners and pulls off one of the harshest ad pivots in history."

The gents break down how Alex responded to the news that Andrew Breitbart had died. We all cope with loss in our own way, and Alex apparently copes by lying a whole lot and spreading conspiracy theories about the deceased."

Thus, the gents dive deep back into the past to see what Alex was doing about a decade ago. Spoiler alert: he was lying and enjoying really good country jams."

Despite him being wrong all the time, was Alex Jones so bad back in 2008? Would Alex Jones be way happier if he had never started selling weird pills and making tons of money?  These questions and more are discussed on this episode."

The pain mostly comes from Alex being in a very weird headspace, and lashing out aggressively at the trans community. There is pain, but there's also pleasure, in the form of Alex not knowing anything about Bitcoin and clearly having a conman as his guest to talk about it."
128,"February 12, 2018","March 5, 2015","March 5, 2015",Time Travel,,Benjamin Netanyahu; Karl Marx; George Soros; Lord Monckton; Joel Gilbert,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan go on a time-traveling adventure as directed by Policy Wonk Jessie, who wanted to know what Alex Jones was up to on their birthday. As luck would have it, that date coincided with the day that Benjamin Netanyahu came to America and spoke to Congress. This sends Alex into a tailspin of uncomfortable Israel-related weirdness."
129,"February 14, 2018",,,David Rothschild,Arizona Arnold Palmer Zero Calorie,David Rothschild,,,,,"Today, Dan tells Jordan about the very weird time when Alex Jones somehow got David de Rothschild to call into his show. At the time, David was promoting the 7/7/07 Live Earth concerts and the book about climate change that he had written, but instead of really talking about any of that, Alex decides to be a huge dick and spout antisemitic conspiracy theories about his guest's family. It is a mess."
130A,"February 19, 2018",,,Endgame,,Big Jim Tucker; George H W Bush; Gary Hart; Dr Michael Kaufman; Ron Paul; Nathan De Rothschild; Woodrow Wilson; Smedley Butler; James Warburg,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan embark on an adventure that is probably a very dumb idea: covering the entirety of Alex Jones' very stupid ""documentary"" Endgame. Dan found approximately 130 specific instances of Alex either lying or ""playing with the truth,"" so this could take a while. In this first episode, the gents learn that Alex doesn't know what ""quote"" means, but he does love Nazi propaganda films."
130B,"February 20, 2018",,,Endgame,,Westbrook Pegler; Big Jim Tucker; Daniel Estulin; Giorgio C Hattin; Henry Kissinger,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan's exploration of Alex Jones' increasingly amateurish and embarrassing ""documentary"" Endgame continues. On this episode, the gents follow Alex to Canada where he yells at strangers with a megaphone, and they learn about how important it is, when you're making outrageous accusations, to have not-insane people be your source."
130C,"February 21, 2018",,,Endgame,,Michael Kaufman; George W Bush; Carroll Quigley; David Rockefeller; Thomas Malthus; HG Wells; Margaret Sanger; Madison Grant,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan enter the part of their Endgame coverage where both of them start to lose patience with Alex Jones' silly games, almost reaching their breaking point before a pizza arrives toward the end of this episode and gave them their second wind."

It's been a long and difficult road, but thankfully, the home stretch includes some demonstrable lies about carbon taxes and an accidental exploration of San Francisco cyberpunk culture."
131,"February 26, 2018",,,David Lynch,,Milo Yianopolis; Rush Limbaugh; Brian Stelter; Steve Pieczenik; David Lynch,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan try to come back to the present after wrapping up their coverage of Alex Jones' ""documentary"" Endgame, but the water is just way too full of garbage to swim in. They dip a toe, then decide to time travel back to 2006, when for whatever reason, David Lynch agreed to call in and talk with Alex, and the big problem this illustrates about Alex's nonsense worldview."
132,"February 28, 2018",,,Minisode,,Jalen Martin,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan have a little episode for you where they discuss Alex Jones' interview with Jalen Martin, a student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Alex's actions in the aftermath of this tragedy, as well as after pretty much every tragedy, are pretty formulaic and uninteresting, but this interview manages somehow to transcend in the arena of distastefulness."
133,"March 5, 2018",,,Operation Paul Revere,,Rob Jacobson; Ashley Beckford; Hope Hicks,,,,,"Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened during Alex Jones' 8 PM shift during his recent ""Help Me I'm Being Sued"" Marathon. It's a classic esoteric performance by a drunk Alex, covering such diverse topics as ""how Alex is a victim because of the lawsuits against him"" and ""how Alex is a victim because the listeners of his show don't give him enough money."" Definitely high end political talk."
134,"March 7, 2018",,,Post Tribulation Rapture,Ice Mountain Sparkling Water,Russell Brand; Jonathan Davis; Noam Chomsky; Steve Anderson; Carroll Quigley,,,,,"Today, Dan tells Jordan about a really good example of how Alex Jones has literally no standards about who he allows on his show as a guest. This is not news, but today's example is the very hateful pastor Steve Anderson, who Alex Jones has on to discuss whether or not the rapture comes before or after the tribulation. As is so often the case, there are far more important issues to discuss."

In reality, Assange was only doing a press conference about how Wikileaks had existed for 10 years, so the Gents just get to enjoy 2 hours of Alex slowly getting more mad."

Unfortunately, he way overshot the start date, so this episode is mostly about how Alex is afraid of science and takes it personally when anyone suggests white people may be bad."

Alex has just been ""on vacation"" for a week, so Alex comes back to the studio feeling a need to remind the people why he's the best.

Most of it is terrible (code for Gavin McGinness), a little bit of it is hilarious (code for Alex's persecution complex). It's too much to listen to, but enjoy."

Most people remember the quotes, but many forget that the kick-off occurred on The Alex Jones Show. Come for the uncomfortable rambling, stay for Alex being a bad friend for broadcasting this."

147,"April 9, 2018",,,Aaron Russo,,Aaron Russo; Nick Rockefeller,,,,,"Today, Dan tells Jordan all about a very important 2006 interview Alex Jones did with ""movie producer turned conspiracy theorist"" Aaron Russo. This interview is a very large piece of Alex's mythology, and upon closer analysis, it is actually a document that may offer a troubling insight into Alex himself."

Depending on who you ask, Mark Richards either is a crazy person who orchestrated a murder in 1984, or he is a Secret Space Captain who was framed because his friendship with Raptor Aliens makes him too dangerous to the New World Order. Whatever you may believe, the new information we learn today is potentially earth-shaking."

How would all of this affect Alex's broadcast the next day?"
221,"October 26, 2018","October 24, 2018","October 24, 2018",Present Day,,Owen Shroyer; Roger Stone; Paul Rosenfeld; George Soros; Brian Stelter; Matthew Fairfield; Darren Huff,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan follow up on the last episode and discuss how Alex Jones' narrative about all of his enemies receiving bombs has evolved, and not in a positive way. It's now a false flag the Democrats are doing to themselves, so the gents discuss how dangerous an idea this is, and how troubling it is that so much of the right wing media is on board with him about it."
222,"October 29, 2018","March 15, 2009","March 19, 2009",Tea Party Investigation,,Barbara Loe Fisher; Andrew Napolitano; Chuck Baldwin; Stewart Rhodes; Charles Dyer; John Ritzheimer; Debbie Stabenow,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan go into the past to see what Alex Jones was up to back in 2009. On this installment, the gents discuss how truth can't really penetrate propaganda, and find an unexpected but ultimately predictable entry point for Alex Jones into the Tea Party."
223,"October 31, 2018",,,Project Camelot,,Kerry Cassidy; Captain Jay; Randy Kramer,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan take a break from talking about Alex Jones to take a much needed Project Camelot break. On this episode, the gents discuss a difficult interview that Sweary Kerry did with a guy who liberated Mars back in the 1970's. Also, Dan found an album Kerry recorded a few years back, and Jordan thinks it slaps."

On this episode, the gents learn about an attempted martial law takeover of Schenectady, an attempt at outlawing you from having a garden, an attempt to force the population into serving the Department of Defense, and of course, how Alex is wrong about everything."
225,"November 5, 2018","November 2, 2018","November 2, 2018",Present Day,,,,,,,"Today, Dan is under the weather, so he cannot handle doing the modern day episode he had prepared to tell Jordan about. Instead, he picks a few of the most important clips from that show and explains to Jordan how Alex Jones has officially abandoned one of his most deeply held principles in the name of supporting Trump's horrific xenophobia."
226,"November 8, 2018","November 7, 2018","November 7, 2018",Present Day,,Ted Nugent; Roger Stone; George Soros; Faith Goldy; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; Andrew Gillum; Jeff Sessions,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan discuss how Alex Jones and Co. are dealing with the results of the 2018 midterm elections. In a shocking turn of events, Ted Nugent accurately assesses that his worldview is unpopular, Alex desperately tries to move product, and Roger Stone swings for the white nationalist fences."

He's been completely obsessed with dishonestly portraying ""the patriots"" as being under attack from all sides, and this episode is nothing if not a continuation of that trend. Also, apparently G.I. Joe is ""Globalist propaganda."""
228,"November 12, 2018",,,Old Alex Clips,,Louis Beam,,,,,"Dan is in the middle of preparing the research for the forthcoming Obama Deception documentary coverage, so he needs a real novelty to really get his mind into the show today. Thus, he decides to tell Jordan about some old clips he found of Alex Jones from his public access days in the Clinton era. What the gents end up finding there is at times charming, and at times deeply troubling."
229,"November 14, 2018",,,Project Camelot,,Kerry Cassidy; Jason Rice; Tony Rodriguez; Randy Kramer,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan take a break from talking about Alex Jones to check in with the wacky world of Project Camelot, to learn about some high class Space Weirdos. On this installment, the gents meet two men who claim to have spent 20 years each working in space. Their stories are interesting, but their revelations about space laws are game changers."

In this installment, we get the lay of the land, meet some of the main players in the documentary, and find so many problems that this episode only covers the first 12 minutes of the film."

In this installment, we pick up on a cliff-hanger and learn about how insane Ron Paul's brother is, then learn a little bit about Ron's career in the House of Representatives. It's not all Paul family stuff this episode though, there's also some historical revisionism and more made-up quotes."
230E,"November 23, 2018",,,Obama Deception,,Justin Fox; Peter Schiff; Webster Tarpley; Ron Paul; Professor Grif; Hitler; George Humphries,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan finish up their look at Alex Jones' 2009 ""documentary"" The Obama Deception, and are lucky to make it out with their sanity mostly intact."

The gents find Alex completely freaking out (and fake crying) about his made up Mandatory Service Bill, and breaking some bad news about a past guest with a really funny name."
232,"November 28, 2018",,,Reverend Manning,,Kerry Cassidy; Andrew Basiago; James David Manning; Stefan Molyneux; Lena Dunham,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan explore the positions of one of Alex Jones' guests, Reverend James David Manning. What they find is a horrifying melange of insanity, historical ignorance, and very offensive homophobia. Please be advised, some of the stuff he says is very hard to hear."

If you don't have time to listen to this episode, it's mostly about Alex reporting on a meme that Donald Trump retweeted. Really hard-hitting stuff."
234,"December 3, 2018","March 26, 2009","March 26, 2009",Tea Party Investigation,,John F McManus; Glenn Beck,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan discuss an episode from 2009 where they find Alex Jones wiggling his way out of his lies about the ""Mandatory Service Bill,"" and welcoming the president of the John Birch Society onto the show for a very interesting interview."
236,"December 7, 2018","December 4, 2018","December 5, 2018",Present Day,,Roger Stone; Tim Cook; Snoop Dogg; Buckley Hammon; Anderson Cooper; Rufio Titan; MAGA Titan,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan dig into a couple of present day episodes of The Alex Jones Show to see what he's up to, and what he thinks about all the news about his friends probably doing crimes. It turns out he doesn't talk much about that stuff, but he does spend a lot of time starting a very bizarre crusade against people who are younger than him."
237,"December 10, 2018","March 27, 2009","March 27, 2009",Tea Party Investigation,,Glenn Beck; Jason Bermis; Bob Chapman; Scott Whitaker,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan pick up their exploration of Alex Jones' career back in 2009, and find Alex taking a stand and changing his position about Glenn Beck.

238,"December 12, 2018",,,Coach Dave,,Dave Daubenmire; Roy Moore; James David Manning,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan introduce another possible Wacky Wednesday candidate, suggested by Policy Wonk Ian. This episode covers a man named Coach Dave, someone who may or may not be a coach, but definitely hosts a surreal extremist Christian radio show. Unfortunately, a little exploration reveals that there's a lot more than religion going on in his broadcasts."
239,"December 14, 2018","December 12, 2018","December 13, 2018",Present Day,,Sandar Pichai; Jair Bolsonaro; Roger Stone; Michael Cohen; Mike Pompeo; Peter Thiel; Maria Butina; Gavin McInnes,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan check in on Alex Jones' present day show to see how he's responding to troubling storm clouds gathering around his Hero President Trump. It turns out he's descended into into a fantasy world where ""Patriots"" are talking over the world and the ""Globalists"" are fighting back with polio. Also, Alex has one of the most severe meltdowns in recent memory because Gavin McInness won't play ball with his attempt to give him a pep talk."

In this installment, the gents find Alex really mad that Obama planned to visit Queen Elizabeth, really mad that he has to let an old man tell limericks on his show to pay the bills, and really mad about Arnold Schwarzenegger."
241,"December 19, 2018",,,Coach Dave/ Larry Nichols,Lagunitas Daytime Ale,Dave Daubenmire; Larry Nichols; Danny Williams; Webster Hubble,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan enjoy a Wacky Wednesday adventure where they revisit the world of Coach Dave, specifically a couple of interviews he did with anti-Clinton propagandist and former Knowledge Fight guest Larry Nichols. The interviews happen around the 2016 election, so they mostly involve Larry saying profoundly dumb stuff and unabashedly advocating for ""veterans"" and ""biker gangs"" to intimidate voters at inner city precincts."

What they found was unsatisfying on that front, but they did find Alex spending a day yelling about Ben Shapiro, and a second day of him being a real dick about a child whose life he disagrees with."

As it turns out, he was obsessing about the bathroom habits of Queen Elizabeth and serving as a distributor for corporate propaganda. Also, Alex becomes increasingly worried that the right wing media is starting to steal his act."

Actually, this episode covers 4 days after that news was reported, since Alex was on vacation at the time, and this is his first day back."
245,"December 28, 2018","December 24, 2018","December 24, 2018",Present Day,,Steve Pieczenik; Steve Bannon; Roger Stone; Julian Asange; Owen Benjamin,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan skip the family festivities and decide to celebrate Christmas Eve with Alex Jones. The gents expected Alex to be getting super religious and weird, but instead they find him admitting to a possible crime, wielding an hatchet on air, and barely talking about Christmas at all. It was a strange holiday for all."
246,"December 31, 2018","April 5, 2009","April 6, 2009",Tea Party Investigation,,Richard Poplawski; Eric Holder; Robert Reich; Glenn Beck; Brad Sherman,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan close out the year with an episode covering the day Alex Jones attempted to lay out all of his rock-solid evidence about how his stories about FEMA camps are totally true. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the result is impressively disappointing."
247,"January 2, 2019",,,LIONEL,,Lionel; George W Bush; Obama; George Zimmerman; Dick Cheney; Todd Akin; Chaz Bono,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan enjoy a Wacky Wednesday adventure looking at one of Alex's guests, the enigmatic QAnon enthusiast, Lionel.

It turns out that his resolution was not ""stop being really weird about Muslims."" Beyond that, Alex has decided to hitch his wagon to a really dumb team of cyber criminals."
249,"January 7, 2019",,,Bill Cooper,,Bill Cooper,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan take a look at Alex Jones' claim that he predicted the attacks of September 11th. Alex made his prediction in July of 2001, but is there more to this story than he is telling? As is always the case with Alex, it appears that there is."
250,"January 9, 2019",,,Project Camelot,,Kerry Cassidy; Not a Doctor John Waterman; Frank Shin; Sean David Morton; Alex Jones; Q; JFK Jr,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan go on a Wacky Wednesday adventure and check in on an interview Sweary Kerry did for Project Camelot back in April 2016.

251,"January 11, 2019","January 8, 2019","January 8, 2019",Present Day,,Gavin Newsom; Mark Dice; Jasmine Barnes; David Knight; Mike Adams; Roger Stone; Owen Shroyer,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan discuss how Alex Jones decided to cover the idea that Donald Trump was threatening to declare a national emergency in order to get his wall made. In a turn of events that will surprise no one, it all turns out being a very racist affair, where Alex makes it way too obvious that he really, really wants to serve a dictator."
252,"January 15, 2019","April 7, 2009","April 8, 2009",Tea Party Investigation,,George Soros; Lionel; Stewart Rhodes; Glenn Beck; Anastasia Churkina,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan venture back into 2009 to follow Alex's path through history. On this installment, the gents stumble into a big change in Alex's rhetoric and try very hard to remember that sometimes coincidences can just be coincidences."
253,"January 17, 2019","January 15, 2019","January 15, 2019",Present Day,,Steve King; Jair Bolsonaro; Dan Lyman,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan check in on the present day of the Alex Jones Show, and what do you know, they find Alex carrying a bunch of water for outright white nationalist Rep. Steve King. A disappointing thing to find, but not too surprising."
254,"January 21, 2019","April 9, 2009","April 10, 2009",Tea Party Investigation,,Captain Sweeney; Captain Phillips; Mark Maron; Tyler Palmer; George Humphrie; Rosalind Peterson; William Black; Chemical Ali,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan learn that, when you're listening to InfoWars, sometimes you're thinking ""eh, what the fuck"" like when Alex Jones complains about how Marc Maron wants to sodomize him. Other times, you're thinking ""what the fuck?!?"" like when Alex begins to describe his feelings about Somali pirates."
255,"January 23, 2019","September 25, 2011","September 25, 2011",Time Travel,,The Who; Peter Stansbury; Ron Paul; Luke Ridowski,,,,,"Today, Policy Wonk Joshua has sent Dan and Jordan back to 2011 to see what Alex Jones thought about the Occupy Wall Street protests. Dan chose this day because it was the day after around 80 peaceful protesters were arrested, and it seemed like Alex might be mad about that. The gents get into this and also speculate that Alex just discovered The Who in 2011."
256,"January 25, 2019","January 17, 2019","January 23, 2019",Present Day,,Covington Kids; Brother Jake; Nicolas Maduro; Juan Guaido,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan take a little glimpse at what Alex Jones is up to in the present day. The gents discuss the predictability of his modern narratives, the absurdity of his stories about his own life, and how a new revelation could change everything about how he should be covered in the present."

In this installment, Alex introduces at least two completely misrepresented documents into his narratives, and Dan expresses that he thinks the mystery of Alex Jones And The Case Of The Tea Party is pretty much solved."
259,"February 1, 2019","January 27, 2019","January 29, 2019",Present Day,,Nancy Pelosi; Roger Stone; Wayne Allyn Root; Rod Rosenstein's sister; Ignaz Semmelweiz; Edward Jenner; General Albert Stubblebine; Benton K Partin; William Gein; Ann Coulter,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan try their best to keep track of what's going on in the present day with Alex Jones. In the aftermath of Roger Stone getting indicted, Alex unsurprisingly starts indicating that he has no interest in defending Trump or Roger anymore, and desperately wants to be who he used to be."
260,"February 2, 2019",,,Project Camelot,,Kerry Cassidy; Sebastian Martin; Zoar,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan take a much needed break from talking about Alex Jones in order to go on an adventure through space with Project Camelot. In this installment, Sweary Kerry sits down with a potential alien and definite Frenchman to discuss his life full of paranormal experiences, but ultimately all may not be what it seems."
261,"February 8, 2019","February 5, 2019","February 6, 2019",Present Day,,David Knight; Joe Rogan; Owen Benjamin; General Albert Stubblebine; Mike Adams,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan discuss the struggle that Alex Jones is going through these days. Alex feels like Joe Rogan has been really victimizing him lately, and the gents really hate to see someone go through something like that."
262,"February 11, 2019","April 14, 2009","April 14, 2009",Tea Party Investigation,,Big Jim Tucker; Clarence Thomas; Willis Cartow; Adrian Salbucci,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan look back to 2009 as Alex Jones inches closer to America's first Tax Day while the Tea Party is a thing. That doesn't factor into this episode all this much, since Alex has Big Jim Tucker on the show as a guest and he ends up saying a word on the show that is a huge problem."
263,"February 13, 2019",,,Jordan Takes the Wheel,,Mark Moreno; Pat Robertson; Aldo Leopold; Bjorn Lomborg; Al Gore; Barbara Streisand; Dr William Happer; Christina Figueras; Patricia Espinosa; Scott Pruit,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan switch roles on the show, to see how that feels. Jordan is very passionate about climate change, so for his episode he decided to find a particularly distasteful climate denier to go over. Also, Dan seems to have a lot of possibly inaccurate thoughts about music when he doesn't have to prepare for an episode."
264,"February 15, 2019","February 11, 2019","February 13, 2019",present Day,,Gavin McInnes; Ilhan Omar; George Soros; Roger Stone; Joe Rogan; Charles Murray; Leo Zagami,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan talk about what Alex Jones is doing in the present day.

There were a lot of theories about what Alex Jones might have been interested in talking about back in Fall 2011, but no one could have predicted that he would dedicate about a third of his show to talking about how much he likes the idea of teachers hitting students."
266,"February 20, 2019","December 14, 2012","December 14, 2012",Sandy Hook Investigation,,Big Jim Tucker; Larry Grathwald,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan decide there's no time like the present, so they embark on an investigation into how Alex Jones covered the tragedy at Sandy Hook. How did Alex come to the position where he would say on air that the events were staged? How long did it take him to get into those narratives? Episode one of the investigation may not answer any of the ""big questions,"" but it certainly provides a number of clues."
267,"February 22, 2019","December 16, 2012","December 16, 2012",Sandy Hook Investigation,,Adam Lanza,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan continue their investigation into how Alex Jones behaved in the immediate aftermath of Sandy Hook. In this installment, Alex has had a few days to regroup after the shock of dealing with the breaking news while on air. Will that affect how he carries himself?"

In this installment, the gents see a solidifying of Alex's ""this is all about my guns"" mentality, but also the beginning of a troubling drift toward finding ways to sensationalize things that everyone knows will not end well."
269,"February 27, 2019","December 19, 2012","December 19, 2012",Sandy Hook Investigation,,Rob Dew; Larry Pratt; Piers Morgan; Stewart Rhodes; Tench Coxe aka Mr Facing-both-ways; Ted Nugent; John Rappaport,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan continue their investigation into how Alex Jones behaved in the immediate aftermath of the shootings at Sandy Hook. In this installment, the gents learn more about how awful Ted Nugent is, discuss UK crime statistics, and struggle with Alex taking a serious turn in his rhetoric for seemingly no reason."
270,"March 1, 2019",,,Joe Rogan,,Joe Rogan; Eddie Bravo; David Jones; General Albert Stubblebine; Nick Beggich/Begitsh; Ralph Northam; Wernher Von Braun; Steve Pieczenik; George Soros; Bill Gates,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan don't want to do it, but they discuss Alex Jones' recent appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast. Most of the conversation is about how Alex is a mentally unwell person, but a fair amount is also about how Joe is incredibly stupid and allows Alex to lie to him a bunch. Oh well."
271,"March 4, 2019",,,Project Camelot,,Kerry Cassidy; Pierre Sabak; Robert Temple; Andrija Puharich; Uri Gellar; David Icke; Isaac Asimov,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan take a much needed break from talking about real things to see what's happening in the world of Sweary Kerry and the space weirdos. In this installment, the gents meet a guy who thinks that language is a conspiracy, and learn that Kerry has recently found out about decades-old Marvel characters' backstories."
272,"March 6, 2019","December 20, 2012","December 20, 2012",Sandy Hook Investigation,,David Icke; Bob Barr; Jan Morgan; Susan Collins,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan jump back into their investigation of Alex Jones' behavior after the Sandy Hook mass shooting.

They mostly find some of the same old nonsense, but more importantly, they catch glimpse of a sign that Alex's days in business may be numbered."

After finishing recording his own show on Tuesday, Alex Jones and PJW did an ""Ask Me Anything"" live on the air, and things did not go quite how any of them may have planned."

As the new year begins, Alex is still deep in his ""gun paranoia"" holding pattern, but thankfully he keeps things interesting by telling a weird story about his past brush with Hollywood and interviewing a major player in the rise of militias in the early 1990's."

Unsurprisingly, Alex attempts to create absurd narratives and implies that the attack may have been a false flag, while dancing around some real gross victim blaming behavior."
278,"March 22, 2019","January 3, 2013","January 3, 2013",Sandy Hook Investigation,,Piers Morgan; Callers; Dave in Wyoming; Obama; Ron Paul; Mitt Romney,,,,,"Today, Dan and Jordan continue their exploration of what Alex Jones was up to back in the days and weeks after Sandy Hook. In this installment, it appears that Alex recently learned about gaslighting. He spends most of the show accusing the ""Globalists"" of gaslighting people, while gaslighting his audience like crazy."

Does Alex admit he still thinks there's something fishy about Sandy Hook? Does Alex's lawyer pick a fight with opposing council as a distraction? Does Alex accidentally reveal that he doesn't even care enough to know basic details about the shooting he's being sued for lying about? The answer to all these questions is yes."
