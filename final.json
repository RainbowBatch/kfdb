      "The world on Jan 19, 2017<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/5/15/jan-19-2017 Jan 19, 2017]</ref>:\n\n*This was the last day before Donald Trump would officially be inaugurated as president. Many attempts had been made to avoid that turn of events, from lobbying the Electoral College, to Jill Stein's attempts at recounts, but the inevitable came to pass.\n*In one of his last days in office, President Obama commutes the sentence of Chelsea Manning.\n*Trump's pick for Secretary of The Interior, Ryan Zinke said in his confirmation hearing that he would consider reviewing the ban on arctic drilling.\n*Trump's pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos was caught in a couple tough situations in her confirmation hearing. The first was when she claimed that she was listed as the Vice President of her mother's foundation on tax forms for multiple years due to a \"clerical error.\" The other was the revelation that she and her husband have investments in student debt collection agencies.\n*Almost 60 members of Congress announce their intention to not go to Trump's inauguration.\n*People are out protesting pipelines in Texas, Tennessee, Florida, and North Dakota.\n\nWhat was happening with Alex Jones:\n\n*Alex was broadcasting from Washington D.C. in anticipation of the inauguration of Donald Trump. This was to be a culmination of everything he had worked so hard for, but Alex's thoughts were clearly elsewhere. Instead of enjoying this victory, Alex spent almost his entire show implying that Democrats were planning not to show up because they had foreknowledge of a terrorist plot against the ceremony.\n*Alex claimed on this episode that the way that the Democrats (or Globalists) would take out Donald Trump was C.O.G. (Continuity of Government). Continuity of Government is a term that describes having a plan for the government to continue in crisis situations. Most world governments have established orders of succession in place, and our Continuity of Government plans date back to the earliest days of our country, when we were worried about the British capturing our heads of state or even the entirety of the Continental Capital city of Philadelphia. What C.O.G. is not is a plan to assassinate a leader, it is a formulated plan to make sure that our actual government survives attacks. It sounds kind of smart to dumb people though, so Alex ran with it.\n*Alex, sensing that it is too late for anyone to do anything about it, reveals that Donald Trump has been an Anti-Globalist sleeper cell since the 60's. It's an absurd idea, and looks very embarrassing in hindsight. This revelation continues into Alex being really weirdly defensive about people thinking he hates gay people. He also is sick of black people thinking he hates black people, and he admits that his ancestors owned slaves. It's a confusing road.\n*Alex does his world-famous impression of Cookie Monster.\n*Alex continued his persecution complex, going so far as to suggest that \"people from the Establishment\" have been hissing at him while he's been in DC. I cannot prove that this hissing incident did not happen, but I am certain it did not happen at all how Alex describes\n*As a show of impartiality, Alex (along with Rob Dew) gives a very subtle plug for Trump's new hotel on his broadcast. It was, undoubtedly, an unpaid advertisement.\n"

They further took responsibility for a suicide bombing in Kuwait that killed 27.\n*The 3-week manhunt in New York for the two murderers who had broken out of prison ends. One of the escaped prisoners was killed by the police, and the other apprehended.\n*Puerto Rico announces that it will not be able to pay off its $72 billion in national debt.\n\nOur episode covering the June 29th edition of The Alex Jones Show:\n\nWhat Alex Jones covered on June 29th:\n\n*Alex believes that the Democrats are using radicals to shift the Overton Window further toward degeneracy and progressive ideals. He uses the example of Jocelyn Elders and evidence that this is something that the left does, not taking into account what Ms. Elders actually said, or the context of her comments that normalized masturbation.\n*Alex indicates that he is against the sanctions placed on Russia for their annexation of Crimea.\n*Alex spends a lot of the show spreading fear about the financial situation in Greece. While the situation in Greece was very troubling, Alex's coverage appears to be mostly motivated by a desire to convince his audience that the global currency market is about to collapse, in anticipation of his \"interview\" with Midas Resources owner Ted Anderson on July 2.\n*Alex plays a video of Mark Dice asking people on a beach to sign his petition to create a new national flag. The video is nonsense, however the way it is covered is illuminating. The process goes like this:\n**Alex posts the video of Mark Dice's report on InfoWars website\n**The Drudge Report picks up the video and posts a link to it with the headline being something along the lines of \"Liberals Call To Ban American Flag\"\n**Alex, to better frame his coverage of the video on his radio show, reports on the link that is in the Drudge Report as opposed to the video itself. As such, Alex's reporting is about liberals calling to ban the flag, instead of what the video actually is, namely Mark Dice annoying people on a beach and a few of them politely signing the petition so he will leave them alone.\n**The \"news\" cycle is complete. Alex posts something, it is warped by Drudge, and then Alex is able to report on the new fun-house mirror version of the original thing he posted. This is literal propaganda.\n*Alex conducts an interview with Lionel, the one-named pundit. Lionel lays out a plan for how he feels the liberals/Globalists would destroy our country. With hindsight, it is startling how similar this plan is to what Donald Trump would go on to do/reinforce as president.\n*Alex has still not mentioned that Trump is running for president\n"

Just before this, Comey had requested additional resources to expand the investigation into the connections between Trump campaign members and hostile foreign agents, particularly Russians. Many believed that the firing was retaliatory, but Trump apologists argue that Comey was out of line in his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's server (and probably Benghazi). White House spokesman Sean Spicer's account put responsibility for the decision to fire Comey on advice from the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (he has disputed this claim), but Trump's own account contends that he's been planning to fire Comey long before Rosenstein's memo.\n*Attorney General Jeff Sessions wrote a memo to Trump advising him to fire Comey. This is, very possibly, a violation of his pledge to recuse himself from all investigations into Trump campaign members and their connections to Russia. Some experts have speculated that this could be possible grounds for disbarment, and potentially even impeachment.\n\nWhat Alex Jones was up to:\n\n'''Knowledge Fight Podcast covering May 10'''\n\nIn the wake of Comey's firing and the inevitable questions it will raise, Alex desperately needs to get control of the narrative. Instead of dealing with the subtle issues involved in firing a Director of the FBI, Alex's agenda is 3-pronged:\n\n**Claim that Comey was secretly a Globalist, blackmailing Trump with fake investigations\n**Claim that Comey was weird, and that behind the scenes no one liked him\n**Argue that it is time for Trump to \"go on the offensive\"\n\nThe last point is an overt call for Trump to shore up his power, and essentially is an indication that Alex Jones is okay with the idea of Trump setting in motion a authoritarian coup of our government. This sort of thing is in direct conflict with the principles that Alex's career was built on, but he pushes this narrative all the same.\n\nHe allows himself to believe it because he thinks (or at least claims to think) that Trump may have to use authoritarian techniques in order to crush a greater evil, namely The Globalists. However, this is not ''why'' he is pitching this narrative. This is a question that has no answer at present, but it does not appear that his willingness to contradict a 20 year career by uncritically joining a politician's cult of personality is a decision he would make unless out of desperation.\n\nThough Comey's firing is absolutely the biggest piece of news in our country, Alex spends surprisingly little time covering it. Instead, he discusses the following:\n\n*Alex conducts an interview with Roger Stone, a man who almost certainly was being investigated by the FBI, about how great it is that Comey got fired. [https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/us/politics/roger-stone-senate-trump-russia-documents.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0&referer=https://t.co/wZwmKQXld6 Senators told Stone not to destroy any documents] back in March 2017, which is a strong indication that he was at least being investigated by the Intelligence Committees in Congress, if not other entities. The lack of journalistic ethics displayed by Alex Jones in having an interview with Stone, without disclosing his position as a likely target of Comey's investigation, is staggering.\n*Alex makes erroneous claims about Trump [http://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Russia/gasoline_prices/ hurting Russian gas prices] by suggesting that we are going to start using coal again. Further, Alex lies to make it seem like \"clean coal\" is a real thing, [http://insideenergy.org/2016/10/11/clean-coal-fact-or-fiction/ though it is not].\n*Alex tells a highly dramatized version of \"elites\" trying to lure him to join their side. This is an essential part of his narrative about himself, as it illustrates that he is on a selfless crusade to wake up the masses. His standing up for truth is being done at the cost of him living the luxurious life that everyone else dreams of. If you believe him about this one thing, you are essentially signing off that 1) evil elites actually exist (which has to be true, since they tried to tempt Alex), and 2) Alex is not motivated by money (or selling t-shirts and weird supplements) and therefore he is above reproach. We believe that no such tempting ever happened, and this is a piece of fiction that Alex uses to subconsciously get his listeners to accept these premises without realizing they're doing so.\n*Alex makes some suspiciously worded calls to violence. You can make the argument that he is not enciting violence, but at very least, he is threatening that violence is  going to become necessary if people don't stop trying to take down Trump. The thing that makes this very problematic is that he is saying these things within a rant that began with thoughts about race, vis-a-vis misrepresenting Black Lives Matter. When the monologue begins with racially based complaints about civil rights groups, it is very difficult to hear Alex's in any other way than as deeply racist. The threats, the othering language; so much of his bullet points are themselves popular dog-whistles (\"we actually work,\" \"we built this country,\" etc), and it is very hard to believe that he doesn't know that, or that he is doing this accidentally.\n"

The president's story about the circumstances of his firing were communicated inconsistently by the president and his surrogates. Many believed it was an attempt to impede the investigation of Trump's ties to Russia. Others balked at the idea and thought the firing was a result of Comey's incompetence.\n*Grand juries had been convened, possibly about some Trump associates (Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Jeff Sessions, etc), and the FBI executed at least one search warrant on a GOP fundraising organization, the Strategic Campaign Group. Though on the surface, it may appear to have nothing to do with Trump's 2016 campaign, Strategic Campaign Group has close connections with Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and most ominously, with right-wing billionaire hedge fund manager/campaign purse, Robert Mercer.\n\nWhat Alex Jones decided to cover:\n\n*A very large portion of the show is taken up ranting about a video that Keith Olbermann released through GQ. Olbermann's video was a plea to foreign intelligence agencies to release whatever information they may have on Donald Trump. His main argument is that there are clear indications of an authoritarian regime taking shape, and once an authoritarian regime reaches a certain point, our normal institutions cannot protect us from them. So, though leaking classified information is wrong, it is a smaller wrong than allowing our democracy to erode. Alex Jones takes 35 minutes of his show to scream threats at Olbermann and accuse him of \"textbook sedition.\"\n*Alex admits that seeing Muslim women in public makes him uncomfortable.\n*Alex on multiple occasions judges new White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders entirely based on her appearance, having no idea how he is embodying sexism.\n*Alex misrepresents this history of both the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130425162315/http://americansecurityproject.org/ASP%20Reports/Ref%200072%20-%20North%20Korea%E2%80%99s%20Nuclear%20Program%20.pdf North Korean] and [http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/coldwar/page12.shtml Chinese] nuclear programs\n"

Rob Dew comes on air to talk to Alex about his boners (not a joke) for a little bit, but he does not count as a guest.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThe Malaysian Plane (MH370) went missing three days prior, and thus far, Alex has not given an opinion on the matter. While the rest of the media can't talk enough about this plane, and it seems ripe for conspiracy speculating, Alex has been suspiciously mum. Today, he breaks his silence and loosely speculates that Iran was behind the plane's disappearance, though he is non-committal about it.\n\nBeyond that, there is very little going on with this episode in terms of real content. Alex jumps around from topic to topic very randomly, mostly hitting on his favorite topics: guns are the ultimate version of Civil Rights, \"kissing girls\" and \"fighting\" are signs of possessing humanity, the literal devil is real. Oh, and we learn that Alex can hypnotize people.\n\nBeyond that revelation, there is not much happening for the show, and then, about two hours in, Alex Jones gets very defensive about the products he sells on his website, particularly Super Male Vitality.\n\nIt appears that people have been (rightly) accusing Alex of selling a boner aid product and pretending that it is not a boner aid product, and Alex is pretty unhappy about it. He dances around how it will give you a boner, but it's so much more, and then decides to drag Rob Dew into the studio to put him on the spot about how hard Super Male Vitality got his dick, and what Dew's wife thought about it.\n\nThe show has gone off the rails in a completely disgusting fashion, but thankfully Rob Dew tries to get things back on track by talking about the Malaysian Plane, but it turns out that neither he nor Alex know anything about the situation.\n\nAlex still has time to fill on the broadcast, but by the two-hour point, he is pretty hungry, so he has an employee go out and get him a hamburger, which he proceeds to eat on air. As if that weren't bad enough, Alex turns it into an advertisement for Super Male Vitality and some of his other products, as he uses them as condiments and dresses his burger with way more than the daily recommended dose of his supplements.\n\nIt's pretty gross, it's incredibly embarrassing, but it's also pretty funny when you consider that Alex Jones is a man who wants to be taken seriously, yet does this on air after talking to his \"news director\" about how his wife felt about him getting more boners while taking the products they sell.\n"

Kasowitz also represents the largest bank in Russia, which gives the feeling of a conflict. Further, Trump's front-runner to be named FBI Director, Joe Lieberman, works at Kasowitz's firm, which would be a definite conflict of interest.\n*Former CIA Director John Brennan testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he had seen evidence of contacts between Russian agents and persons involved in the Trump campaign that made him \"concerned.\"\n*The Senate Intelligence Committee issues subpoenas for two of Michael Flynn's businesses. They had previously subpoenaed Flynn himself, but he chose to ignore that and invoked the 5th amendment. Businesses, however, cannot plead the 5th.\n*President Duterte of the Philippines declares a state of indefinite martial law in the Mindanao region of his country, claiming that rebels had seized control. A transcript of a phone call between Trump and Duterte is leaked wherein Trump tells Duterte he's doing a great job on drugs. Since last June, more than 7,000 people have been extrajudicially killed by police because of drug offenses. Police have claimed \"self-defense.\"\n*The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announces that U.S.-led airstrikes have killed 225 civilians over the past month, including 44 children.\n*Thousands march in Chicago to demand a minimum wage increase to $15/hr.\n\nWhat Alex covered on May 25:\n\n*This episode is mostly about how Jerome Corsi has been told some major information and has warned Alex that he may be killed over the weekend. Alex has been given the greenlight to get into two of the four pieces of news that Corsi thinks will get him killed, but as it turns out, neither of these things are real or even really news. The stories are:\n**The Democrats not only killed Seth Rich, but they also wanted everyone to ''know'' that they did it\n**Trump has definitive proof that the Democrats gave foreign nationals access to the NSA databases in order to spy on US citizens. This appears to be based on a story that broke on Friday (a full four days before Jerome Corsi was due to come on to discuss it). It looks to be a sensationalization of [https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/icotr/51117/2016_Cert_FISC_Memo_Opin_Order_Apr_2017.pdf this declassified document], a review of the intelligence community's handling of information collected by FISA.\n*Alex spends a lot of time trying to shore up InfoWars' credibility. He cites a story about XBox's being able to spy on you, and Millie Weaver exposing a member of Antifa. As he talks about these stories, it is kind of clear that the XBox thing isn't quite what he's talking about, and Millie Weaver was just repeating things that she read on 4Chan.\n*Alex plays 3 \"special reports\" because he is so worked up about the Corsi news. The reports are all terrible, and are:\n**Paul Joseph Watson talking shit on Katy Perry not hating Muslims enough\n**John Baun discussing the elites (mostly Katy Perry) loving Satan\n**Mark Dice mocking John Kerry's attempts at humor during a commencement speech.\n*Larry Nichols returns to the show to explain that he has \"top level sources\" that the Democrats are going to try to impeach Trump in the next six months. This sort of revelation does not require any kind of source, it's pretty obvious. He spends the rest of his time on the show talking about how evil Hillary is, and how Alex is still humanity's only chance.\n*Larry goes on to repeat falsehoods and conjecture about the death of Seth Rich, implicating Donna Brazile and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.\n*Mike Cernovich comes on the show to spread innuendo about Mike Pence working against Trump behind the scenes, and about Lindsey Graham being behind a bunch of leaks.\n"

      "The world on June 18th, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/6/18/june-18-2015 June 18, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*On the evening of June 17th, Dylann Roof entered Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and murdered nine people in cold blood. He would be apprehended on the morning of the 18th, and it subsequently came out that his motivation was entirely based on a racist ideology. He explained that he had hoped to start a race war, and that one of his primary motivations was his sense that black people were taking over \"our country.\" He would go on to be sentenced to death for his horrendous crimes.\n*Donald Trump, a day after announcing his candidacy for president, utters his now famous words:\n\n<blockquote>\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\n\"</blockquote>\nWhat Alex Jones covered on June 18th:\n\n*It is Alex Jones standard operating procedure to immediately call any major event (especially traumatic ones) a false flag. He is generally quick to point the finger at the Globalists, but in this case, I think even Alex could tell that this was going to be a pretty tough sell for him to make on his own. Thus, he started out the show with a fairly ambivalent tone about whether or not it was a staged mass murder:\n*Alex plays the \"maybe it was fake, maybe it wasn't\" game for most of the episode until, toward the end of the show, he conducts and interview with Rev. Childress. Childress goes on to make all the points Alex felt he could not earlier in the show, and by doing so, he essentially gives Alex permission to expand the narrative, call the event fake (or at least planned), and make it all about how the Gobalists want to take away guns.\n*Over the course of the show, Alex seeks to find ways to deflect from the reality that a horrible racist mass murder had happened, and he didn't really have a great spin for it. In order to attempt to move his listeners attention elsewhere, he frequently tries to downplay the Charleston murders because they pale in comparison to the number of abortions that are performed. Multiple times, he says that, if Roof were serious about killing black people, he should have gone to work at Planned Parenthood. It's hard to tell if he thinks he's being funny or poignant, but easy to tell he's succeeding in being neither.\n*He goes on to develop this theme further and suggests that secretly, when they're not being recorded, that liberals support abortion because it kills black people that they don't want to support. The way he delivers this piece of information reinforces my belief that the person he's talking about does not exist, and that these genocidal liberals he's seen off-camera are a figment of his paranoid imagination.\n*Alex goes on to further deflect from the reality of the Charleston murders by listing off people who have been \"mind controlled\" to do terrible things in the past, including but not limited to Timothy McVay, The Aurora Batman Shooter, and the Unabomber. Most of these cases are far from conclusive, vis-a-vis \"mind-control.\"\n*Alex also takes the opportunity to demonize medications, being as Roof was apparently on Suboxone. While it is true that many medications are over-prescribed, and some regulations should be in place to safeguard from that, it is irresponsible to paint psychiatric drugs with such a broad brush. Medications can have negative side effects, but the way Alex couples medication and losing your free will is dangerous, and could scare people away from life-saving drug treatments.\n*Dylan Roof made comments about how he felt that black men were \"taking our women.\" Instead of engaging with this belief as a piece of a racist cosmology that is really more about misplaced hated than it is about sexual impotence, Alex responds primarily by calling Roof a weirdo who couldn't get a girlfriend. The implication here is that if he could have gotten a girlfriend, he would not have harbored dangerously racist beliefs, which is just not true.\n*Paul Joseph Watson filed a \"special report\" about how white people are the real victims in society.\n*Alex gave the first indications that he is aware that the 2016 election season was starting, as he conducted an interview with former Clinton associate Larry Nichols. The interview is mostly Nichols talking about how evil both Clintons are, and how if they don't like you, they will kill you like Vince Foster. This interview is critical, for two reasons:\n**The entire interview is about how if Hillary Clinton becomes president, the world will end. Everything will be destroyed. Alex had these ideas before, but there is a sense that he is also getting new marching orders, or at very least starting to understand that the narrative has to be destroy Hillary to save the world.\n**It is now two days after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the office of the president. Alex makes no mention of him, and seems to be oblivious or completely indifferent to his running. As of June 18th, 2015, Alex Jones has not yet made the leap.\n"

Basically, no matter what you believe about the shooting, Alex believes that if you think it had anything to do with race, you are foolish.\n*Alex claims that the National Rifle Association was created specifically to help arm black people to fight back against the KKK. This is categorically not true, and [http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/05/harry-alford/nra-founded-fight-kkk-black-leader-says/ is just based on a debunked comment] made by Harry Alford in 2013. [https://home.nra.org/about-the-nra/ The NRA's website] cites their creation as being motivated by some generals in New York being disappointed that their troops were bad marksmen and were wasting so many bullets.\n*Alex conducts an interview with former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura. At the time, Ventura had just won a defamation case against Chris Kyle, author of American Sniper. In his book and subsequent TV/radio appearances, Kyle had told a story about how one night at a bar, Ventura spouted off a lot of anti-America/anti-Marine speech, so Kyle kicked his ass. Ventura was appearing on Alex Jones' show because Kyle appealed the verdict and Jesse needed to raise some funds. Ventura's claim on the show was that all the major players in the media were behind the appeal, and that they were afraid that if Ventura's judgement stood, they would no longer be able to print lies about people. If they could overturn the case, they would be free to enrich themselves unjustly by slandering whoever they wanted. There are a ton of problems with this:\n**The media companies were not behind the appeal. It was Kyle's widow (since Chris himself had been murdered by that point). Further, media companies absolutely have the right to report on claims that are made that turn out to be untrue, and are not subject to lawsuits for doing so. Integrity demands that they make a correction if they learn later that they reported a lie, but Ventura's argument is flimsy as hell.\n**The case that Ventura initially won was very dubious. The jury could not come to a consensus, and after five days of deliberation only reached an 8-2 verdict. Both Kyle and Ventura provided witnesses that gave contradictory accounts of the night in question, and a judge in his appeal case called it \"a credibility contest.\"\n**Ventura would go on to lose this appeal and have the $1.8 million judgment awarded to him reversed. The reason was not because the media wants to be able to slander people, it was because Ventura's lawyer attempted to manipulatively sway the jury. Throughout the trial and in closing arguments, Ventura's lawyer kept talking about how HarperCollins (Kyle's publisher) had insurance that would cover the settlement if he won. The court allowed this argument, but on appeal, it was determined that they had failed to prove that such an insurance policy existed, and mentioning it unfairly biased the jury to find in his favor since it is shifting the consequences to a faceless entity as opposed to a widow.\n**[http://media.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/16/06/143876P.pdf You can't sue people for unjust enrichment in Minnesota] unless you are in a contract with them.\n*Still no mention of the fact that Donald Trump is running for president.\n",
      "The world on June 21, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/6/21/june-21-2015 June 21, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Donald Trump has been running for president for 5 days.\n*The Congressional Budget Office announces that repealing the Affordable Care Act could increase the national debt by $137 billion\n*84 people die in Mumbai, India as a result of drinking toxic homemade liquor\n\nWhat Alex covered on June 21:\n\n*Alex has gone from being hesitant to call the Charleston shooting a false flag to being pretty comfortable with the position. He still hedges his claims by saying that \"black preachers say this things stinks to high heaven,\" but it is clear from his language that this is his position as well.\n*Alex has had about enough of talking about Charleston and how the explicitly racially motivated shooting wasn't about race, so he uses his Sunday show to transition to a new narrative. He keeps the \"2015 Will Be The Summer Of Rage\" element from the previous narrative, but his new story line is primarily about how he has heard from \"billionaires\" that the Elite Globalists are starting to evacuate to \"armored redoubts.\" He is never specific about anything, and this is a claim he's been making every day since, that the elites are *just about* to leave.\n*His secondary narrative takes up most of the show. He has read a study about how the Earth is currently in the sixth extinction period of our history, [http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/scientists-build-case-sixth-extinction-say-it-could-kill-us-n378586 which is not at all inaccurate]. As the argument goes, us humans are in no way immune from the forces that cause extinction, so we should be careful. Granted, the article is titled very \"click-baity,\" suggesting that humans are up next, but that's what allows Alex to use it to build his narrative that the Globalists are behind the extinctions, and they're telegraphing that they're going to kill off humanity.\n*Jakari Jackon does a live report from Charleston about how the community has really come together and it's an inspiring thing to see. He talks about how beautiful the church service he attended was the night before, and seems to be excited about a march that was going to take place that evening. He brings up how weird it is that there are monuments to white supremacists on the same block as Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. It's a great report. The entire time, Alex keeps trying to shift the conversation back to negative things like a possible race war, and imaginary forces wanting to ban the Confederate flag.\n*Alex explains that the key to understanding everything (I kid you not) is a Chik-fil-A billboard he saw recently. He explains that its \"psychological warfare\" because the cows are drawn realistically, whereas the chicken is drawn as a blob which humanizes the cows but not the chickens. I believe he was trying to make an abortion metaphor, based on the fact that the chicken just looks like a pile of goo. What Alex fails to take into account is that the premise of the billboards is that they are drawn by cows, who don't have fingers. They lack the motor skills to draw accurate chickens with their hooves. There are a hundred other complaints I could lob against his interpretation of this very clever ad campaign, but this isn't the place for it. Just listen to his blow-hard analysis.\n*Continuing an anti-abortion theme, Alex explains that Michelle Obama is more racist than David Duke.\n*Alex has yet to mention that Donald Trump is running for president.\n",

It is a tremendous sign of unity and hope.\n*Then-FBI Director James Comey declines to call the shooting an act of terrorism, saying that terrorist acts are generally more politically motivated acts. This is a very fine line.\n*Dylann Roof's manifesto reveals that the website for the Council of Concerned Citizens opened his eyes to the \"brutal black on white crime\" epidemic. This is clear evidence of the argument that far right wing propaganda is responsible for radicalization. The president of the CCC, Earl Holt is revealed to have donated substantial amounts of money to many Republican presidential hopefuls, including Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.\n*Julian Assange celebrates his third anniversary in the Ecuadorian Embassy.\n\nWhat Alex covered on June 22:\n\n*Alex gets cooking on this episode by laying out his eldritch vision of the what is to come. This clip is a pretty concise explanation of his view of what the Globalists are going to do, but doesn't include reference to a lot of their \"side projects\" (turning frogs gay, for instance). It goes without saying that this is an absurd paranoid fantasy, and he appears to just be kind of riffing it out. Unfortunately, he is not.\n*Alex insults the religious beliefs of the Egyptians, due to their belief that mummifying a pet would allow them to enter the afterlife with you. He laments a society built around this \"whacked out bull.\" Alex doesn't pause to reflect that he too believes in an afterlife and that if he behaves correctly according to an ancient book, he will be rewarded there, and that a great deal of our American society has been built around that equally weird belief system.\n*Alex conducts an interview with former Ron Paul financial adviser Peter Schiff. The two men really just go to town on how the \"bubble\" is too big, it will probably pop any day and bring with it total financial collapse. Alex is clearly laying the groundwork for something, in terms of narrative, but it's unclear at this point what that thing is.\n*Paul Joseph Watson comes on the show to screen an incredibly offensive, entirely pointless \"special report\" about people with trans identities. It appears that he conceived of the sketch in response to Rachel Dolezol (a story that broke on June 12, a full 10 days prior), but it misses the mark entirely and ends up being an exercise in cruel mockery of anyone who doesn't fit the mold that white, Christian, patriarchal society deems normal. It is such an embarrassment that Alex cuts it off in the middle, claiming it was \"too racy\" (also because he didn't bleep the n-word)\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1495858015458-O3K4WOYI3PL0Z7RK9S4S/image-asset.jpeg|thumb|none]]\n\n*Paul Joseph Watson, perhaps to make up for the swing-and-a-miss of his trans sketch, claims that there is no rape culture in the West, and that no one seems to care that there are problems with rape in a bunch of other cultures. He goes on to explain that there is no gendered wage gap and that Hillary Clinton is running for president on feminist lies.\n*Alex believes that the Globalists are trying to distract people from TPP by getting them riled up about the Confederate flag, so to offset that, he embarks on a very interesting retelling of the Civil War, which includes a very bizarre and unsettling brag that \"rednecks who know stuff bow down to me.\" This narrative that the Civil War wasn't really about slavery, and that it was about tariffs, has been [https://imperialglobalexeter.com/2015/03/02/debunking-the-civil-war-tariff-myth/ thoroughly debunked], and contradicts South's own secession convention documents (Fun Fact: [http://historymuse.net/readings/mississippiresolsecession.html Mississippi's Resolution of Secession] mentions \"slave\" or \"slavery\" ten times, but never once mentions \"tax\" or \"tariff\"; [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp South Carolina's] mentions slaves 18 time and \"tax\" once, but in a sentence about taxing slaves). There are plenty of other deeply flawed, subtly racist inaccurate claims Alex makes in this clip, but probably too many to list here. At this point, making these sorts of arguments is a definite indication of either: a) being completely misinformed, or b) holding slavery-apologist beliefs (or both)\n*Alex Jones has still not mentioned that Donald Trump is running for president.\n",

This is happening around the world, with deaths caused by heat waves increasing precipitously.

This is the first time in 16 years their government has done so\n\nWhat Alex covered on June 23rd:\n\n*Alex Jones is incredibly bent out of shape over the Trans-Pacific Partnership being fast-tracked through Congress. He is absolutely certain that this one thing, the TPP, will be a death blow to the very idea of countries. According to him, it is not a trade deal, but an essential piece of stripping countries of their sovereignty and combining them into a one-world government.\n*Alex spends a very large chunk of this episode playing a clip of then-Senator Jeff Sessions giving a speech on the Senate floor about how bad the TPP is. Though he is not at this point explicitly identified with the Trump campaign, this is the first instance of someone who would come to be a major Trump player getting positive coverage on the show in the 2016 election season. Alex calls Sessions a \"super patriot.\"\n*Alex conducts a return interview with alleged \"Clinton insider\" Larry Nichols. The last time he was on, he essentially told Alex that it was up to him and his listeners to save the world. This time is no different, as he strokes Alex's ego and builds up the savior complex that would propel Alex into losing his mind during the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n*Larry Nichols promises to be back on the show every week, and on each appearance, he would reveal a new bombshell Hillary Clinton revelation. This week's: One time, Hillary Clinton went to a \"witch church\" with someone from Designing Women (sadly not Meshach Taylor)\n*Alex continues to insist that the Civil War was not about slavery. According to him, it was actually about every other possible thing, but definitely not slavery.\n*Alex conducts an interview with economist (?) Max Kaiser. Max is insistent that the dollar is just about to collapse. It will come any day now, and he has lots of conjecture and insinuation to back that claim up.\n*Alex reveals that (as we all know, according to him) Hollywood is run by Jewish and Italian mobs.\n*Alex has still not mentioned that Donald Trump is running for president.\n",

Walmart, Etsy, and Amazon have expressed that they are not going to allow sales of Confederate flag items.\n*Boko Haram kills 42 civilians in two Nigerian villages.\n\nWhat Alex Jones covered on June 24th:\n\n*'''PIVOTAL EVENT: '''Alex explains on this show how he had a dream the night before that \"lasted six hours,\" and it was unlike any dream he's ever had. He describes it being like a prophecy, a prophecy of what the world is going to be like if the Globalists win. He is not very specific about details, but the way he speaks, it becomes clear that he has internalized this dream as some kind of message from the divine. This combines with the \"you are the only person who can save us\" comments that Larry Nichols made on the show on June 17th, and the picture of Alex's mentality for the 2016 election starts to come into focus.\n*A lot of this episode involves Alex not really understanding that a lot of people have sincere feelings about societal issues. His position seems to be that all race, gender, and sexual orientation/identity issues are a distraction from bigger issues, and anyone who deeply cares about these sorts of issues is either actively working for the Globalists or is tragically being fooled by them. Alex lays out two examples from his life that he feels illustrate this:\n**Alex doesn't like that people are against the Confederate flag, since it's just a symbol, plus lots of gangs wear professional sports teams' gear. One time Alex wore a 49ers hat and a cop asked him if he was in a gang. This argument is not compelling.\n**Alex doesn't like that people are against the selling of the Confederate flag because when he was a kid, he bought Nazi memorabilia, and that doesn't make him a Nazi. Fair enough, and most people would agree with that, but it is every business's decision to make about what they will and won't sell.\n*Alex conducts an interview with Paul Craig Roberts wherein the two side with Russia about the annexation of Crimea. They take the position that Russia is just trying to help the people of Ukraine deal with the manipulations of the Globalists.\n*Alex conducts an interview with a college student named Lauren Southern. Southern is a reporter for Rebel Media, and she is on the show because she had recently posted a video where she went out to confront women at the Slut Walk. Here are a few clips from Lauren's report, with Alex muttering pretty offensive things in the background.\n*Alex Jones has still not mentioned that Trump is running for president\n",

The Globalists have shackled us, so we think that 60% is actually 100%. It's a convoluted conspiracy theory version of a junior high school football coach pep talk.\n*Alex tells a story about being schooled by a \"very high level Globalist\" on a plane. This Globalist in question explained to Alex that humans, when introduced to the technocratic slavery that's coming, they won't fight it, they will adapt to it, as humans always do to their environment. We feel that this conversation didn't happen, as evidenced by the level of detail and dramatization that Alex gives the story.\n*Alex puts some of Charlton Heston's business on the streets.\n*Alex and Anthony Gucciardi do a 30+ minute infomercial for Brain Force. It is so long, and it is literally all sales pitch. It's about 25% of his entire showtime, a show that theoretically has commercial breaks where this stuff should go.\n",

He is still massively outmatched by Hillary Clinton in terms of fundraising.\n*Macy's stops selling Donald Trump branded products in response to public outcry regarding his disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants.\n*Wikileaks publishes much of the text from the TiSA (Trade in Services Agreement), another international trade agreement being discussed by heads of state, and some claim that it is more important to our country's trade agenda even than TPP.\n*Girl Scouts in WA reject a $100,000 donation because the donor insisted the money not go to programs benefiting transgender girls. This Girl Scout chapter started a campaign #forEVERYgirl, and raised over $300,000, which could be used however they like.\n\nWhat Alex covered on June 3rd:\n\n*Alex believes that Trump is just in the race for publicity and that he is a shill to help Hillary get elected.\n*Alex says that he does not trust Donald Trump, going so far as to say that Trump is not actually rich, and that he is a \"front man for some consortiums on the East Coast,\" which is clearly a reference to the mob. This level of awareness in 2015 is very hard to square with Alex's state of mind in 2016 and 2017.\n*Alex plays a video of Joe Biggs interviewing people around Austin about what we are celebrating on the 4th of July. It is a direct rip-off of a Mark Dice video they had played the day before, and it is inane. Alex uses the very clearly cherry-picked responses from people who don't know that we declared our independence from Britain to prove that everyone (especially \"liberal trendies\") is dumb, and that he (and his listeners) is the only person who still loves and appreciates America. This is something that he comes back to over and over on the show.\n*Alex makes the claim that trial lawyers are secretly behind the push to legalize same-sex marriages, so they'll have other people to fleece. It's worth noting that Alex recently went through a divorce at this point, so it is fair to assume he's a little biased. Alex weaves this theory into a proclamation that heterosexual marriage is \"regular marriage,\" and if you disagree, you are mentally ill.\n*Alex tells a story of when he was descended upon by Satanists when he was covering an anti-abortion rally. The way he tells the story is hilariously over-the-top, and clearly untrue. The reality, if you watch the actual video (bizarrely titled \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2hKIrMVt08&spfreload=10 Sexy Women Hail Satan and Love Abortion]\"- clip starts at about the 9:30 mark), it is very clear that these supposed Satanists are trolling. It is very unlikely that Alex doesn't understand that these people aren't actually crying out to Satan, and that he is just using this to score propaganda points.\n",
      "The world on July 5, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/5/july-5-2015 July 5, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*British Petroleum agrees to pay out $18.7 billion in a settlement stemming from their 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A large amount of these fees BP is paying are due to the Clean Water Act, which is something that Republicans in Congress are trying to dismantle.\n*Jim Webb declares his intention to run to be the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election. This is the definition of a footnote in history.\n*It is announced that the most wanted terrorist in Tunisia, Seifallah Ben Hassine, was killed in a US airstrike in Libya in June.\n*A woman in Washington state dies of measles, being the first American to do so since 2003. The United States was declared \"measles-free\" in 2000, but most likely due to a growing number of people becoming anti-vaccination, the disease is making a comeback, with a total of 644 reported cases in 2015, the highest tally recorded in 15 years.\n*President Obama announces he will commute the sentences of dozens of nonviolent drug offenders.\n*Washington state announces that they have brought in an additional $70 million in tax revenue due to their legalization of weed.\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 5th:\n\n*Most of this show, Alex is still covering the financial situation in Greece, but doing so through the prism of how it is a test run of what the Globalists are going to do to the United States. Though the situation in Greece is, and was, awful, and the banks were acting in an exploitative fashion, it is incredibly difficult to take financial analysis seriously from someone fear-mongering while they stand to financially benefit from people buying gold (Alex's distributor, Genesis Communications Network is owned by Ted Anderson, also the owner of Midas Resources, a gold and silver sales company).\n*Alex doubles down on his previous comments about how he does not trust Donald Trump. He goes so far to even say \"Donald Trump doesn't matter.\"\n*Alex reiterates his feelings that Trump is untrustworthy, but also indicates that he does like Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It is worth noting that Alex agreeing with Trump's xenophobia is not enough to convince him to sign up with Team Trump.\n*Paul Joseph Watson also indicates on this episode that he does not trust Trump. He says he thinks he is a narcissist and is just in the race for publicity.\n*Alex is very mad about the \"knockout game,\" wherein youths videotape themselves attacking strangers. Fears about this social media phenomenon were the subject of much coverage in right wing media, but Alex's take on it is so very racial. As he expresses in this clip, he feels that \"gangbangers\" are gods to hippies and trendies, so they become easy targets for attack. In contrast \"good old boys in trucks\" aren't being the victims of the knockout game, because everyone knows they have guns. The coded language displayed here is intentional, and is a subtle message to his overwhelmingly white audience about who is to blame for the problem, namely these turncoat hippies and trendies.\n*Most of the rest of this show is covering a tragic story of an undocumented immigrant who murdered a white woman in San Francisco. Alex is furious about this, and spends a very large chunk of time on it, repeatedly drawing focus to her white-ness, and insinuating that this is the motivation for the crime, or at very least that people don't care about her being killed because of her being white. It is an act of complete twisting of reality. He brings in an unrelated quote from Black Nationalist leader Khalid Muhammed to try to inject overtones of racism against whites into the situation. Alex revisits this same case on subsequent episodes, but never really does any true analysis of it, past the point of spreading fear about this supposed \"immigrant menace.\" He even warns that people from all over the world are coming to the US to engage in \"murder tourism.\" Juxtaposing this level of coverage when one white person is killed to how dismissive he was after the Charleston shooting, and the fact that he never questions the murder of a white person as a \"false flag,\" should tell everyone what they need to know about what really matters to Alex, namely white identity.\n"

      "The world on May 31, 2017<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/5/31/may-31-2017 May 31, 2017]</ref>:\n\n*Donald Trump accidentally tweets out \"Despite the constant negative press covfefe\" and immediately, pretty much everyone on Twitter started clowning on him. Covfefe temporarily became the world's greatest punchline. In the morning's press conference, Sean Spicer claimed that Trump, and a small group, knew exactly what he meant.\n*80 are killed and more than 350 wounded in a massive explosion in Kabul, Afghanistan. No terrorist group immediately claims responsibility, but it is unlikely to have not been an act of terror.\n*Mike Flynn has agreed to turn over documents related to the investigation into his (and Trump's) Russian ties to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Flynn had previously refused to turn over subpoenaed documents and announced that he would plead the fifth. This change has prompted many to guess that he may have struck a deal with prosecutors for immunity.\n*Trump announces that he will take the United States out of the Paris Agreement, joining Syria and Nicaragua as the only countries to do so. North Korea signed it, for some perspective. This is seen as a devastating development in the fight to get climate change under control.\n*Trump announces that he plans to roll back the diplomatic efforts that Barack Obama had made with Cuba. Most people cannot find a good motivation to do so.\n*President Duterte, having declared a state of martial law in the region of Mindanao, implies to his soldiers that if they rape women in Mindanao, they will not be punished. His record on human rights just keeps getting worse.\n\nWhat Alex covered on May 31st:\n\n*Almost this entire show is about how mad Alex is at Kathy Griffin, who recently released a picture of herself holding a facsimile of Trump's decapitated head. Alex sees this as the moment when the anti-Trump crowd have jumped the shark, not taking into account that no one really supports Kathy Griffin, no one liked what she did, and that CNN was quick to fire her over the picture with or without a call to boycott their sponsors.\n*Alex miscalculated the response that CNN and the left would have to Griffin's picture, so he and Mike Cernovich hatched a plan to start a trolling campaign wherein they are selling shirts with the picture on it, with the worlds \"CNN Terrorist\" underneath, and they are giving away money to people who wear it on the news. Alex thinks this is going to be huge, but it doesn't look good. Now that CNN has already fired her, there isn't really anything for them to be fighting for, and the underpinning of their argument has kind of fallen apart.\n*Through their words, and the nature of the \"contest,\" it's abundantly clear that this is really about Alex trying to: a) sell a ton of shirts, and b) trick his audience into creating massive amounts of free press for him. Currently, all his products are on a massive discount, and he said on a show last week that he was losing a number of affiliates. The smart money says that Alex and Cernovich knew that they desperately needed something to kick them out of this dangerous slump, and saw this picture as their shot.\n*Roger Stone claims that he discovered a George Soros-planted mole in the government. It is a pretty underwhelming conspiracy, all things considered, and there's nothing in his revelations that really seem to add up to anything nefarious.\n"

      "The world on July 6, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/6/july-6-2015 July 6, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*61% of Greek citizens vote to reject austerity conditions for a financial bailout. The situation seems very uncertain, but most are encouraged by the Greeks taking control of their future.\n*Nuclear talks with Iran continue in Vienna, after they recently were given an extension when sides could not reach an agreement by the established deadline. John Kerry expresses the position that, at this point, things could go either way.\n*Pope Francis begins an eight-day tour of South America, beginning in Ecuador, promoting a campaign of environmentalism.\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 6th:\n\n*This show is very weird. Alex appears to be in a very weird mood, which leads to this moment in the middle of the episode where Alex reveals that he almost couldn't go on air that day.\n*After he screams his way into a break, he comes back after the commercials and explains that he engaged in a \"controlled rage\" during the break and he now feels better. This seems to be something that he does a lot, and indicates that he may not be very able or willing to engage in healthy anger management techniques.\n*It appears that one of the reasons that Alex is in such a bad mood is because he only takes in news from propaganda outlets. On this episode, he explains his media routine, and it seems to mostly include reading stories posted on InfoWars (his own website), and reading the comments looking for \"tips.\" It is a fascinating glimpse into how even the man making all the money and controlling the organization is still hurt by the influence of propaganda.\n*Because Alex has worked himself up into such a bad mood by reading dishonest stories on his own website, he is in no shape to actually do a show. He spends most of the show taking callers who all agree with him.\n*In the middle of a jag about how he doesn't want people to make him feel \"white guilt,\" Alex reveals that even Jerome Corsi, a man who has known Donald Trump for 40 years, has told Alex that Trump is a shill. Everyone who eventually comes to support Trump are going on record as having inside knowledge that he's not to be trusted.\n*Alex tells a story about hanging out with Willie Nelson that is supposed to explain that Alex sells quality products because he doesn't want people to boo him, but ends up revealing that he is a bit of a prude.\n*Alex conducts an interview with \"trends researcher\" Gerald Celente. A lot of it is about the impending financial collapse, and they do recommend that people buy gold, a recurring theme on programs supported by Genesis Communications Network.\n",
      "The world on July 7, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/7/july-7-2015 July 7, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*61% of Greek citizens vote against a bailout of their economy involving austerity measures. Greek banks remain closed, and negotiations continue regarding emergency loans.\n*A Saudi-led coalition carries out strikes in Yemen, killing at least 200, many of which were civilians.\n*President Obama vows to continue the offensive on ISIS, saying \"Our airstrikes will continue to target the oil and gas facilities that fund so much of their operations. We're going after the ISIL leadership and infrastructure in Syria, the heart of ISIL that pumps funds and propaganda to people around the world.\"\n*New York City agrees to a $300,000 settlement in a case brought against them by six Occupy protesters who were pepper sprayed by Officer Anthony Bologna, while they were peacefully demonstrating and caught behind a police crowd control net.\n*A study finds that, of the 2.400 elected prosecutors in America, 95% are white. The study further found that 79% are white men. In 66% of the states that elect prosecutors, none are African Americans. This creates an immense bias in the legal system that is often ignored when reform is discussed.\n*Court documents from 2005 are released wherein Bill Cosby admitted that he gave quaaludes to women he intended to have sex with. Somehow he is still not in prison.\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 7th:\n\n*A lot of the show was spent intentionally misleading the audience about what President Obama recently said about the fight against ISIS (or ISIL, as Obama calls them). The substance of what Obama said is that, in the case of terrorism, military might is not enough to defeat them. What is required is a better ideology. Alex intentionally misunderstands his comments to mean that Obama is saying that we are not going to attack ISIS because they are his personal proxy army to kill Christians. The reason he does this is because, if he did not misinterpret the comments this way, he would have to admit that he agrees with Obama about something substantive (Alex constantly talks about how \"Americana\" will inspire the world, etc).\n*Alex conducts an interview with Lord Monckton, a British gentleman who believes the EU is a fascist organization that is doomed to failure. An interesting conversation could be had about how things are particularly doomed to fail when parties actively work against them, but that is not the conversation that the two men have.\n*Alex gets defensive about Jade Helm. Many people believed that Jade Helm was a planned army takeover of Texas (among other parts of the country deemed \"hostile\"). Alex claims that he never said it was real, just that it was conditioning the public to prepare for an eventual war against patriots. It's a fine line to draw, and I cannot comment on whether or not his claims about his coverage are true. This will be updated as evidence is found.\n*Alex talks about his experience going back to Bohemian Grove on the History Channel show Decoded with Brad Meltzer. His telling of the events makes enough sense, when he is talking about this reality TV visit to the Grove. However, it is very important to note that Alex Jones, most likely, was completely lying about his initial \"infiltration\" of Bohemian Grove. Alex claims that he \"exposed\" the existence of the grove, but you can see here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0NAHmtAG00 a news story from ABC about Bohemian Grove from 1981], a full 19 years before Alex's \"documentary.\" Further, journalist Philip Weiss sneaked into Bohemian Grove in 1989 for six whole days, [http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/bohemian_grove_spy.html and wrote an extensive article about it], and really described the Grove as being basically a drunk summer camp for rich dudes (he experienced everything that Alex talked about, like the Cremation of Care ceremony, he just experienced it in context, and doesn't have a vested interest in selling fear). Further, consider these two videos, each pointing out very serious problems with Alex Jones' Bohemian Grove documentary. The first discusses how Alex doesn't actually have footage of any of the things he talks about in the video. The second discusses the geographical problems, how Alex's account of where he claims he went just does not match up with Google maps, or the Grove's own maps.\n*Alex spends a lot of time on this episode announcing that news director Rob Dew's uncle, a former FBI agent, is \"investigating Sandy Hook.\" In 2017, Alex Jones claims that he never said that Sandy Hook was a fake event, but we have shown time and again that he did make those claims repeatedly, and in varying contexts. Below, you will find a clip of him telling a caller that no kids died at Sandy Hook, and under that, is the actual audio from Dew's uncle that they are basing their new reporting on. He says nothing other than that \"he's never seen something like\" this, which most people would say about the senseless murder of schoolchildren. Alex repeats many thoroughly debunked claims put forth by unscrupulous sources, and cites the work of discredited opportunist/victim family harasser Wolfgang Halbig. It is an embarrassment to journalism, and decency.\n",
      "[https://www.democracynow.org/2015/7/8/headlines The world on July 8, 2015]<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2016/7/8/july-8-2015 July 8, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Defense Secretary Ash Carter reveals that our program to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels has not been as successful as they had hoped. Due to intense screening requirements, the program only had 60 members that could be trained. This program has cost taxpayers $500 million in 2015\n*Guatemalan government backed sponsors have testified that former dictator Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt is not mentally competent to stand trial for genocide, as he oversaw the killings of 2,000 Ixil Mayans. Experts say the 89 year old is unable to understand the charges brought against him.\n*New York City announces plans to get rid of bail for low-level and non-violent offenders. Protesters called for this after multiple deaths occurred in Rikers Island, including the suicide of Kaleif Browder, a 22 year old who spent 3 years in Rikers after being accused of stealing a backpack, but he could not afford the $3,000 bail. He maintained his innocence, and the charges were dropped, but his death was an absolutely avoidable tragedy.\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 8th:\n\n*Previously, Alex was predicting that the financial collapse was going to come \"this summer.\" Since we are a week into July, on this episode, Alex adjusts his prediction to winter.\n*Alex expresses support for Nigel Farage and UKIP. They are reasonable allies, as they both hate the EU, but since events transpire the way they do over the next 18 months, it is important to point out what changed about Alex's positions and what did not.\n*Alex tells a story that probably didn't happen about people on the streets of Austin insulting him for supporting Trump. In this clip, we begin to see the external world forcing Alex and Trump into a similar box. All the same, Alex still denounces Trump. \"Trump has never been my boy,\" he says. Alex compares Trump to the commotion about the Confederate Flag or Caitlyn Jenner, in terms of being a manufactured distraction.\n*Alex conducts interviews with Greg Palast (about the troubles in Greece), and Harry Dent (about how the economy of China is a fraud).\n",
      "[https://www.democracynow.org/2015/7/9/headlines The world on July 9, 2015]<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/9/july-9-2015 July 9, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*The Guardian reports that Exxon knew about climate change in 1981, a full seven years before it became a matter of public debate. Internal emails show that they were fully aware of the science back then, and engaged in a campaign to fund climate change denial to the tune of at least $30 million over 30 years.\n*Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley, as well as the Green Party candidate Jill Stein, have promised to not accept any campaign donations from fossil fuel companies.\n*Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake fires Police Commissioner Anthony Batts over his handling of the arrest of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody under very suspicious circumstances. Further, the Baltimore police union issued a review accusing Batts of ordering officers to allow looting and property destruction during an uprising over Gray's death, which left 19 buildings burned.\n*California Congressmember Barbara Lee introduces the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act, or EACH Woman Act, hoping to invalidate the Hyde Amendment which bans federal funding for abortion.\n*FBI Director James Comey testifies before the Senate that the FBI needs backdoor access to encrypted devices and software. Tech companies have come out against this, warning that the dangers to privacy outweigh the potential security assistance.\n*The UN announces that the refugee population due to the Syrian War has exceeded 4 million, and that due to hostilities, an estimated 7.6 million people have been displaced. Antonio Guterres, U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said, \"This is the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation.\"\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 9th:\n\n*Almost this entire show is about how mad Alex is about a trailer for a show on MTV called White People. The show is intended to teach white youth about the nature of cultural privilege, not to convince them that they are evil, but that they live in a set of circumstances that have come into being because of outright oppression of minorities. Alex does not understand this, and his defensiveness about his white identity almost drives him to the point of insanity while covering this trailer.\n*Alex alleges that he has been attacked by black people more than Martin Luther King Jr was attacked by white people, which is basically an insultingy reductive take on the Civil Rights Movement. Alex believes that the street fights he got into as a kid were him being racially targeted, which is something too absurd for us to unpack here.\n*Alex conducts an interview with Larry Nichols, which is involves a couple of main points. First, Larry needs money. He has medical bills and is appealing to Alex's audience to help. Second, he wants everyone to know that the Clintons were swingers (in addition to witches), and that Chelsea isn't Bill's daughter. Lastly, he wants to explain to the audience that Barack Obama is trying to turn the US into a Muslim caliphate, which would then make him the leader of Islam globally. It's an absurd premise, and you can hear him explain it in the below clip.\n*Alex thinks that doctors and schools are trying to convince kids, who would not be inclined to do so otherwise, to be gay or trans. He relies on a very misleading, inconclusive, and unprofessional video from Joe Biggs to make these completely insane claims. It is an embarrassing look at a man who really believes in a \"gay agenda.\"\n",
      "David Knight hosted the show, so we didn't really care to find out what was being discussed.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/7/17/july-10-2015 July 10, 2015]</ref>\n\nHowever, we accidentally scanned through the episode and landed on this clip, where David Knight laments how everyone misunderstands and maligns the very racist Disney movie Song of The South.\n",
      "'''The world on July 12th'''<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/7/17/july-12-2015 July 12, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Coming Soon\n\n'''What Alex covered on July 12''':\n\n*Alex still thinks that Trump is a shill for Hillary Clinton. He says he still \"doesn't trust him,\" but still is wrestling with his feeling that Trump is \"telling the truth\" about world issues. Alex seems to be caught between wanting to defend the paranoid worldview that Trump espouses and not wanting to have to be associated with such a ridiculous candidate.\n*Alex claims to have information from a \"high level source\" that Trump is deeply connected to the mob, going so far as to say \"with a name like Corleone, you get arrested; with a name like Trump you don't.\" This is very explicit, and is a very big problem when taken in combination with Alex's current position on Trump, namely that he would \"die for him.\"\n*Alex cites a Newseum poll that claims that only 19% of respondents were \"able to\" say that the 1st Amendment to the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Here is the article about the study, which if you read closely, you will see is methodologically flawed. The way the questions are phrased alone calls this poll into question. Also, this statistic is not abnormal for their polling: since 1997, they've never shown a higher percentage than 29% of respondents that know about the freedom of religion. Overall, this is a bad poll, on top of that, Alex is using it poorly.\n*Alex, who on past shows has said explicitly that he owns multiple Nazi guns, is very offended that people are offended by the Confederate flag, and Confederate memorabilia being sold at flea markets. He takes up a lot of his time complaining about this.\n*Alex insists that \"trendies\" only like Muslims because they think hookahs are cool.\n",
      "The world on July 13th<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/13/july-13-2015 July 13, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Coming Soon\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 13, 2015:\n\n*Alex explains that Donald Trump is \"from the WWE,\" and unlike Jesse Ventura who grew out of that stuff, Trump treats the real world like pro wrestling. He goes on to say that you'd have to be stupid not to see through the charade of him faking being against Hillary.\n*Alex is starting to show an affinity for Russia and Vladimir Putin. His version is that they are one of the only countries left that is still \"male,\" which just taken alone is a weird position. He thinks that Russia is the only major country in the world that is standing up to Globalism, not realizing that there is another possibility, namely, that the civilized world sees a legitimate threat in Putin, and is largely unified against him. Alex is beginning to make clear that he sides with Russia.\n*Alex reveals that he is related to the Tudors. In the past, he's also revealed that he is related to Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forest, and the guy who \"invented the stock market.\" Alex constantly brags about his lineage, but beyond making wild pronouncements, none of this is ever proven.\n*Alex \"takes one look at Trump, and thinks danger Will Robinson.\" He still absolutely does not trust Trump, and is still firmly in the Rand Paul camp.\n*Alex says that \"casino owners are slimy,\" and literally calls Trump a predator.\n*Alex conducts a long interview with Anthony Gucciardi, which is really just an infomercial for his products, something that is happening more and more lately. In this installment, they give the backstory of Dr. Group. The real backstory is that he's not really a doctor, but actually a chiropractor. Their version is much better, and involves his dad being an evil scientist who created many of the toxins that are hurting humanity currently. At a certain point, Group rebelled against his father and made it his life's work to undo the damage he had done to the innocents of Earth. It's absolute drivel, and even pitched as a comic book character origin story, it would be \"a little derivitive.\"\n"

Alex conceives of the 4th hour as an \"intense news roundtable,\" and constantly pitches it like it's going to be hard-hitting straight up news and analysis. To put it politely, there is a lot lost between his conception and his execution.\n*Alex explains why he's becoming more religious lately. This would probably be impossible to type out, so the clip is provided below.\n*Alex conducts an interview with Larry Elder, which is the first instance of Alex talking to someone with decidedly pro-Trump feelings. Larry Elder is not someone I would be taking too much guidance from, considering the following two clips, where he defends Todd Akin's \"legitimate rape\" comments, and implies that the Charleston shooting wouldn't have been so bad if everyone were armed. It is the definition of missing the point on both counts.\n*Alex suggests that President Obama is to blame for racial strife in the country.\n*Alex reveals that he did not pay for the abortions that he has claimed to have paid for in the past (and did a lot of soul searching and praying about and forgiven himself for).\n*Alex has an interview with \"biggest whistleblower ever\" Tosh Plumley. It is largely about Benghazi, and how that was an elaborate gun-running operation gone wrong. Most of their conversation is thoroughly debunked talking points and baseless speculation.\n*Lee Ann McAdoo hosts the 4th hour.\n",
      "David Knight hosted, so we don't know what the show is about.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/15/july-15-2015 July 15, 2015]</ref>\n\nHowever, we're gonna guess it was about the Jade Helm 15 exercises, since they kicked off that day. We hate to speculate, but we bet that Alex took the day off just in case Jade Helm was real.\n",

As it turns out, what this means is that Alex still doesn't trust Trump, but that he is going to stop bringing up that he is a mob-connected, slimy casino owner. What changed his mind was apparently watching a couple YouTube videos over the past weekend. It becomes clear, in hindsight, that someone told him to stop talking about the mob ties. Alex makes clear that he doesn't endorse him, just that he's going to stop talking shit. Given the astounding levels of self-censorship Trump has bullied the press into imposing on themselves, I would not be surprised if this was an early example of that.\n*Alex explains that no one else can see the Globalists because they are incapable of seeing such evil or even admitting that kind of evil exists in the world. This is insane.\n*The Center For Medical Progress has begun releasing heavily edited anti-Planned Parenthood propaganda videos, and Alex cannot get enough of them. The videos would go on to net their creators multiple felony charges for videotaping people without their consent (all those charges are still pending at the time of this writing). They likely committed many other crimes, including a possible racketeering charge for creating a fake company for the purpose of fraud, but a lot of that still has yet to be worked out in court. The important thing is that the videos they released were found to be misleadingly edited to make it appear that the subjects of the videos were haggling over the price of baby organs, which they were not. The other important thing is that Alex Jones falls for it hard, and spends the next months of his show screaming about their videos.\n*One of the themes of his complaints about the Planned Parenthood videos is an underlying classist dog-whistle, wherein he consistently attacks the women in the videos for being at \"high end restaurants\" and drinking \"fine wines,\" when nothing in the videos even indicates that they are in such a place or drinking anything other than table wine. It is clear that he is doing this to try to take his audience's anger at the upper-class \"elites\" and merge it with their hatred of people who support abortion.\n*Alex claims that he never said that Jade Helm was real, and that anyone saying such things should be ashamed.\n*Then, at the end of the show, he gets a call from someone in Alabama who claims that armed UN agents attacked him at a Walmart, and Alex offers to fly out that night. Spoiler alert, he does not follow through with this.\n*Jesse Ventura calls in and has what seems like a very healthy perspective on Trump, and the consequences of his rhetoric.\n",
      "The world on July 17, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/17/july-17-2015 July 17, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Coming Soon\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 15th:\n\nThis episode is so insane, that I cannot cover it in bullet points. It is perhaps the weirdest thing that I have ever experienced watching months and months of The Alex Jones Show, and even now as I type this out, I find it mystifying. July 17th...The Day Alex Jones Intentionally Jumped The Shark\n\nI know exactly what Alex was trying to do in this episode. It's pretty clear that what he wants to do is cast himself as Jonathan Swift as he makes his very own Modest Proposal, but Alex does not realize that he is not making a logical point at all. He thinks he's making a shocking statement that's backed up by logic, but in reality, he's just exposing his own poor grasp on reality and his extreme hatred of Muslims.\n\nIn his essay, Swift used the suggestion of the poor selling their babies to be eaten by the rich as a way to highlight and mock how horribly the rich treated the poor already. It is an exaggeration made by heightening an already existing problem.\n\nConversely, Alex Jones' \"modest shark jump\" is him calling for the deportation of every Muslim, the banning of all mosques, and all Muslim symbols, ostensibly using the logic that \"some people want to ban the Confederate flag, so why not ban all Muslim things?\"\n\nHere, he falls into a number of logical traps. I will list them out for you:\n\n**In order for this to be satire (he claims that he is not being satirical, he is just using logic, but I disagree), he would need to be satirically advocating a position that he does not already tacitly support. He has many times in the past expressed deeply held feelings of distrust toward the Muslim community, and has often conflated radical terrorists with the general Muslim population. This is not an instance of him making a headline-grabbing statement to point out a social problem, it's him reaching the logical conclusion of his beliefs. He wants to outlaw Islam, and is using this weak argument as a shield to give him cover to express that.\n**If he wants to use this \"Shark Jump\" to start a conversation, it's a flawed premise. He acts like people want to ban the Confederate flag, therefore it makes sense for him to call for other iconography to be banned. But, the reality is that people were calling for Confederate flags to be taken down from government buildings, so the only real outcome that can come from this conversation is the conclusion that Islamic flags should also not be flown at government buildings, which I think most people already agree on.\n**Even if people were calling for the banning of the Confederate flag, which they were not, it still doesn't logically track for that to be analogous to banning Islamic iconography. In order for them to be equivalent, Alex would need to first make the argument that the Confederate flag was a religious symbol, and the Confederacy a religion, thereby making them logically relatable. I grant, flying a Confederate flag on your property is protected as free speech, but the argument of \"they want to ban A, so I suggest we ban B too\" doesn't work under these conditions. Also, people weren't trying to ban the Confederate flag.\n**But, Alex is not just calling for the banning of Islamic iconography. In his thought experiment, he is proposing essentially outlawing a religion, which he sees as being analogous to banning a Confederate flag. Just taken in terms of scale, this is pretty unfair as far as comparisons go.\n**He tries to use logic to make his argument, but he clearly has no experience in using actual logic. If you don't look at what he's saying, and you're already a bigot, his words may make sense to you. The problem is, the argument he's making is substantially more complicated than he thinks it is, as I attempt to lay out below:\n*Premise A: Terrorism being carried out by Muslims hurts people (\"A Muslim has hurt someone\")\n*Premise B: The Charleston shooting carried out by a white person hurt people (\"A white person has hurt someone\")\n*Premise C: All white people are blamed for the actions of one white person in the Charleston Shooting (\"If one white person has hurt someone, all white people are to blame\")\n*Premise D: If all white people are blamed for the Charleston Shooting, then all Muslims should be blamed for things that any individual Muslim does.\n*Premise E: If a group is blamed for the actions of an individual member of their group, that group has hurt people.\n*Premise F: If a group has hurt people, then their symbols should be blamed and banned.\n*Conclusion: All mosques should be closed, all Muslim symbols should be banned, and all Muslims should be deported.\n\nThis argument just doesn't work, for any number of reasons. First, the conclusion in no way follows from the premises. If all he wanted to do was ban Muslim symbols, then at least the conclusion makes sense from that standpoint, but he in no way introduces the idea of deportations and closing of mosques into the premises.\n\nMore importantly, the premises also just aren't true. In order to have a sound argument, you need to have true premises that logically lead to a true conclusion, which is a bar Alex has failed to reach.\n\nAll white people weren't blamed for Charleston, what happened was that many took it as an opportunity to examine the devastating effect the history of white supremacy has had in this country, and how that mentality has not disappeared at all. It was an opportunity to reflect on how differently people of different races experience day to day life, and wrestle with the fact that, as white people, we possess a lot of advantages that we have not earned, and those advantages have roots in our country's white supremacist history. This is not the same as blaming all white people for the actions of Dylann Roof, so Premise C is out. It's also what's known as a composition fallacy.\n\nPremise D is stupid, since it's just really extending the composition fallacy.\n\nJust for fun, I'd like to point out that using his argument, it would follow that since listeners of his program have hurt people in the past, the InfoWars logo should be banned, and he (along with all his listeners) should be deported. You see, when you use a composition fallacy, you open up the door for it to be used against you. It's a filthy business, this logic.\n\nI choose not to even engage with Premise F, and how reductive and offensive it is that Alex would imply that the Confederate flag is somehow important iconography for all white people.\n\nIt's all a mess, and yes, I did break down that argument just to prove to myself that studying logic in college wasn't a complete waste.\n\nAll that said, what makes the \"Shark Jump\" a complete embarrassment is that, as he prepares to reveal his bizarre, logically flawed proposal, he paves the way with a bunch of stories that he thinks are building up his argument, but in reality, he's just lying about all of them.\n\nNow, let us walk through this \"Shark Jump\" piece by piece, taking a break to debunk his stories as they come up.\n\nWhile Alex has a bit of a fair point that terror threats are used to peel back our civil liberties, that is the last thing I can agree with him about here. In the first leg of this trip, Alex builds up how important what he's about to say is, then insists that he's not using satire, which again I insist he is, just poorly.\n\nHe ends by claiming that \"brown bags are being banned in Seattle\" because they hurt some people's feelings. This is not true. [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/theres-more-seattle-brown-bag-racial-controversy-meets-eye-f6C10836263 Here is the story he is basing that on].\n\nThe term \"brown bag\" does have a racially loaded past, in that in the past, people's skin was compared to brown bags to see if they were light enough to be admitted into bars, social events, etc. The story that Alex is referring to is an in-office memo that someone wrote suggesting that people be conscious of this, and asking that people use comparable words that mean the same thing when discussing lunch meetings (sack lunch, for example), that wouldn't possibly make a coworker have to remember that term's history. It was not even a ban on the words, it was just a suggestion that people be considerate.\n\nIn this next chunk, Alex lies about another story about someone suggesting that people be considerate.\n\nHe claims that \"nationwide\" children are being banned from using the words boy and girl, and that, in order to make sure no trans students feel hurt, everyone must be called \"purple penguins.\" This is an incredibly misleading version of the truth, [http://www.snopes.com/politics/education/purplepenguins.asp which can be found here].\n\nBecause Alex uses the term \"purple penguins,\" it is very easy to track this back to the original story. It is not something that is \"happening nationwide,\" and once again, no one is banning anything. What is actually happening is that a group called Gender Spectrum offered guidance to a school district in Nebraska about ways to make sure that all students are made to feel included in their classrooms.\n\nThe guidance included suggestions that mainly had to do with not gendering things that did not really need to include genders. For instance, if you are having children line up, don't separate them as boys and girls, but instead have them split up based on whether they like dogs or cats, or prefer reading or drawing. It is not a way of erasing gender, just a way of trying to not use gender as a dividing binary when it doesn't need to be.\n\nThe advice goes on to suggest that when a teacher is trying to get a group of children's attention, saying \"listen boys and girls\" is just injecting gender binaries where they don't need to be as well, and could make children outside the gender binary feel excluded. It is just as effective to give your classroom a team name, such as \"purple penguins\" (the throwaway example they used), and use that to get the kids' attention.\n\nAgain, this is not an instance of outlawing or banning language, it's just an advocacy group suggesting ways to slightly tweak ways things are expressed to make sure that all children are cared for and made to feel welcome. No one is erasing or banning gender. Just because Alex Jones thinks empathy is a Globalist plot, that does not mean it is.\n\nIn this clip, Alex makes his actual argument, that if people want to ban the Confederate flag, then Islam should be banned. This, even as an intentional exaggeration, is absurd. We went over that already, so no need to dwell on it further here.\n\nHe punctuates his argument by claiming that police are showing up to flea markets to arrest people who are selling \"rebel flags.\" This is a complete lie. [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/flea-market-nazi-confederate-items-offends-customer-article-1.2290455 Here is the story that he is basing this on]. I know this is the story Alex is talking about because it happened two days before this episode.\n\nA Connecticut man went to a flea market and saw a vendor selling Nazi and Confederate items, and was offended, so he called the police. The police showed up, and did nothing because no law was being broken. The vendor was not punished in any way.\n\nThe thing that Alex leaves out of the story, conveniently, is that the man who called the police did so because of the Nazi stuff, not the Confederate flag. You see, this man's grandmother was a Holocaust survivor who had numbers tattooed on her from the camps. His response of being overwhelmed is completely understandable. Perhaps he went a little far in calling the police because of it, but that's irrelevant, because the cops didn't oppress or arrest the vendor. They affirmed his right to sell whatever he wants.\n\nEvery piece of evidence Alex sites in order to prop up his rhetorical comparison is a complete misinterpretation of the truth. He is building up a case of lies about \"politically correct oppression\" that he then uses to justify his argument that, essentially, Islam should be banned.\n\nThis is unbelievably idiotic, only made worse by the fact that he clearly planned out this speech pre-show and really thought he was on to something. In the end, it is all just an embarrassing exercise in a man trying to justify his own bigotry, using pretend intellectual language and hiding behind false equivalences. Matters are only made worse that he decided to do so with this as his backdrop:\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1500347394221-WDNUIDBZTZRMR9Z97Z68/image-asset.jpeg|thumb|none]]\n\nA shark was jumped today Alex, just not the one you think.\n",
      "The world on July 19, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/19/july-19-2015 July 19, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Coming Soon\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 19th:\n\n*Most of today's show is about how a picture of the Queen giving a Nazi salute, as a child, came out. Alex uses this as an opportunity to launch the world's largest \"I told you so\" party. There are a lot of problems with this, chief among them that Elizabeth was 7 when this picture was taken in 1933. In the video, she is clearly being made to make the salute by her Nazi-sympathizing uncle Edward. As weird as it is to think now, a lot of people had Nazi sympathies before WWII really got cooking, there were a number of prominent people who were on Hitler's side to some extent. Also, this picture is kind of irrelevant, because Prince Edward abdicated the throne in 1936, assuring that his lineage would never be monarchs ever again, because he wanted to marry an American lady that the British government didn't approve of. Pointing out that a 7 year old made a gesture because their misguided uncle got them to does not prove shit.\n*Apparently, shock-jock Mancow called Alex to congratulate him on being right about the British nobility. Full disclosure: I was once a guest on the Mancow program, and he was nothing if not a complete jerk. The experience was unbelievably awful, and based on how Mancow carried himself, I absolutely believe that he's the type of person who would be in contact with Alex Jones\n*Without providing any further details, Alex Jones asserts that President Obama is creating a \"race database,\" which presumably would be used nefariously.\n*Alex continues to push the Center For Medical Progress propaganda videos against Planned Parenthood. Investigations have shown that these were all deceptively edited, and Congressional investigation have cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrong-doing, but Alex spends over a month screaming about them almost every day.\n*Alex explains that John McCain did not actually get tortured in Vietnam, and that in fact he was a \"trustee of the Hanoi Hilton.\" Whereas McCain likes to play up his war past for sympathy and political points, Alex knows that in reality, he spent most of the war being pampered by the North Vietnamese and enjoying the company of \"pleasure women.\" This narrative is both fascinating and very offensive simultaneously.\n",
      "The world on July20, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/20/july-20-2015 July 20, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Coming Soon\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 20th:\n\n*Most of this show is about Alex's narrative that he's building that the British nobility are: A) secretly Nazis, and B) literal descendants of Dracula. Alright, that's not fair. I should say, literal descendants of Vlad the Impaler. Most of what Alex is referencing goes back to [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9656769/Prince-Charles-heir-to-Draculas-blood-line.html a Romanian tourism campaign that was trying to entice people to Transylvania] (a part of Romania) by highlighting Prince Charles' distant relation to Vlad. Considering the way genealogy works, if you go back six centuries, you may be surprised to find the bizarre familial connections people have, and quite frankly, given that Vlad had at least three recorded sons and had a period of military adventurism against the Ottoman empire, it's very reasonable to think that he had far more offspring than that, giving him a potentially large lineage.\n*Alex Jones discusses the nature of fear and how standing up to fear is what separates boys from men. To illustrate this philosophy, he discusses how, in his school days, he was not afraid to skinny-dip with the cheerleaders, whereas other kids were. The story he's telling is likely not true, but even if it is, it is not really demonstrative of \"overcoming fear.\"\n*Alex claims that \"Islam has always been about conquest.\" To back up his claim, he points out that Islam is everywhere, which is evidence of its conquest-filled past. He fails to point out that there is at least one other religion with a pretty serious history of conquest that can now be found everywhere.\n*Alex announces that he is launching a TV network, but the details are vague. What's not vague is that he needs a ton of money to do it, so he spends a lot of the show asking for people to buy his products and \"fund the operation.\"\n*Alex has an interview with his newly-hired investigative reporter Wayne Madsen. The interview is about how the Clintons' personal chef was found dead, apparently with a note on him that said to call Larry Nichols if anything happened to him. Madsen asserts that the chef somehow had inside information about the truth about 9/11, and he knew too much, so once Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for president, the chef had to be taken out. It's all a lot of sensational nonsense.\n",
      "The world on July 21, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/7/21/july-21-2015 July 21, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Coming Soon\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 21st:\n\n*Alex begins a pretty short-lived narrative where he believes that Army recruiting centers around the country are under attack, mostly because they are gun-free zones. In order to beef up the story, Alex sends Joe Biggs down to an Austin-area Army recruitment center, where he and about 3 other people, stand guard with guns outside to protect the recruiters. No one attacks, and Alex loses interest in this narrative pretty quick.\n*Alex has fallen for more deceptively edited anti-Planned Parenthood videos put out by the Center For Medical Progress. This will come up pretty much every day for a while.\n*Alex admits that he has met the NY mafia. He has also said that he knows that Donald Trump is a front for them.\n*Alex spouts out one of his favorite lies, that Snopes is run by \"a lady and her cat.\" He desperately needs to discredit Snopes, since anything that involves fact-checking works against Alex's purposes. He can't really argue with ''what'' they do, so he has to attack who they are (at least who they are in his head). Snopes is not run by a lady and her cat. [http://www.snopes.com/snopes-staff/ They have a full staff] of editors, writers, fact-checkers, and support staff. This is simply an instance of Alex making shit up to try to attack people who prove that he just makes stuff up.\n*Alex reveals that he prefers to take Super Female Vitality to Super Male.\n*Alex's 12 year old son Rex is on the show to present a special report about how environmentalists are stupid.

      "The world on July 22, 2015<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2017/8/12/july-22-2015 July 22, 2015]</ref>:\n\n*Coming Soon\n\nWhat Alex covered on July 22nd:\n\n*Alex is deep in the middle of pushing the Center For Medical Progress videos, purporting to show that Planned Parenthood is secretly a racket where doctors are selling aborted baby parts for massive profits. This narrative overwhelms the Alex Jones Show for a few months, until it becomes clear that these videos were fraudulently edited to make it appear that the subjects caught on film were haggling over fetal tissue prices when they were not. It was an example of shameless propaganda and Alex fell for it and promoted it shamelessly.\n*Donald Trump recently made his comments that he prefers war heroes that didn't get captured, about John McCain. While Alex hates John McCain (and thinks that he's lying about being tortured in Vietnam), he interprets Trump's words as being proof that the Republican strategists are telling Trump to torpedo his campaign, which in turn is proof that he is in the pocket of the Globalists. Alex is \"very mad\" at him, and goes so far as to say \"I told you so!\"\n*Alex claims that Melinda Gates threatened his life, if he didn't stop talking about vaccines. This is a perfect encapsulation of how Alex's mental illness manifests.  The quote Alex is referring to is Gates saying that if anti-vaxers are successful in turning people against vaccines, then people are going to die, from the diseases that the vaccinations prevent. Alex hears her comment, and because he is a delusional narcissist, believes that she is saying that if he doesn't shut up about vaccines, then she will kill him. It's absurd, but also uses the same twisted logic that so much of Alex's philosophy does.\n*Alex says that the ATF is a terrorist organization that hates America. Also, they \"did Waco and Oklahoma City.\"\n*Alex pretends that he interviewed George Carlin, but in the course of telling the story, he accidentally reveals that someone spoke to him at a book signing, while getting a book signed.\n*Alex tells an elaborate story about his dad being the 6th smartest kid in Texas at the age of 16, at which point the Globalists tried to recruit him to join their ranks. There is a great deal about this story that does not pass the smell test.\n*Alex puts on a dreadfully transphobic display, wherein he plays a video of himself with brown socks on his ears pretending that he's decided he identifies as a dog. This is childish, and willful ignorance about trans people, but there is another issue that this clip demonstrates that is particularly troubling. Alex reveals that he made this video mocking the idea of trans identities to amuse his young daughters, and that one of them was holding the camera. Beyond that, one of his daughters dresses up in a gorilla suit and appears on camera, with Alex saying that she is an employee who identifies as a gorilla. These children are much too young to have a grasp on the issues, and the fact that Alex is using them to push his bigotry. This is a disgrace, and indicates that he is perhaps a terrible father.\n",

      "At long last, Alex has returned from his vacation. His return brings with it some unsettling commentary about the situation in Ferguson, MO, and some very anti-Donald Trump sentiments.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/8/10/august-10-2015 August 10, 2015]</ref>\n\nAt this point in history, Alex's feelings about the 2016 election are as follows:\n\n*Alex \"trusts\" Ted Cruz, but he loves and agrees with Rand Paul about almost everything.\n*Alex suggests that it is very possible that Trump is being blackmailed into running, in order to destroy the Republican party.\n*InfoWars employee Joe Jennings hates Trump and calls him a megalomaniac.\n*Most of Alex's callers hate Trump and think he is a Hillary shill.\n*Alex prophetically predicts that it is possible that Trump will lead the conservative movement into fascism, since the conservative movement is susceptible for that kind of thing.\n*Alex literally implies that Trump may be the Judas Iscariot of America.\n\nAll this is to say that it is a generally negative feeling for Trump that pervades the InfoWars studio in late summer 2015, though Alex does point out that he likes that Trump is anti-vaccination.\n\nMost of the show is taken up by Alex talking about Trump, and taking the temperature of the audience by taking calls on Trump, most of them very negative. His callers are very gifted at picking up how to mirror Alex's positions back to him, so most of them say \"I don't trust Trump, but I know Rand Paul is for real.\"\n\nBeyond this, Alex complains a lot about how Alex doesn't want people to make him feel bad because of the recent death of Sandra Bland, and in a real insensitive moment, he says he has \"Ferguson Fatigue.\" I can think of few lamer ways to say \"I'm tired of hearing minorities express their experience in ways that make me uncomfortable.\"\n\nAlso, Alex talks about his cool, expensive new car for about 15 minutes.\n\n===Notable Calls===\n\n*Old Man Landline calls in from Wyoming to complain about the Council on Foreign Relations\n*A caller brings up the fact that Trump has exploited eminent domain in the past, and that is something that Alex is very against. The caller also points out that Trump has advocated for the death penalty for Edward Snowden.\n*A 14 year old listener calls in and says that he has been listening for 2 years, then proceeds to parrot back Alex's talking points, as if they were his own thoughts and analysis. This is outrageously inappropriate, and on the call, Alex serves to reinforce this child's indoctrination.. Any decent adult would recognize that the content of Alex's show is not something that a 12 year old could possibly be mature enough to understand or process and encourage them not to listen to it. I would argue that allowing a child to listen to this show constitutes abuse.\n",
      "David Knight hosts most of this show, so a lot of it is a write-off.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/8/11/august-11-2015 August 11, 2015]</ref>\n\nHowever, Alex Jones comes in for a little bit to conduct an interview with highly decorated astronaut Story Musgrave, who clearly has no idea who Alex is. Musgrave thinks Alex's show is a local Austin radio show.\n\nAlex thinks that Musgrave knows about the show and that he is coming on to give Alex some good old fashioned secret information about NASA, but that is absolutely not the case. Musgrave just wants to talk about how important education is and how much he's enjoyed his life. It's a very sweet appearance on the show, and it's extra fun to watch Alex be disappointed this extremely.\n"

Jones, no relation to Alex, is a republican, but also is a Ron Paul type of cat. He is on the show today to talk about how he is trying to lead a movement to remove John Boehner as Speaker of the House, and thus pave the way for a patriot, libertarian speaker. Spoiler alert: Boehner was already given some indications that he was going to step down, and he was replaced by Paul Ryan, someone who could not be further from the idea of a \"patriot, libertarian speaker.\"\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAlex is pretty worked up on this episode. He is absolutely predicting that the Chinese economy is about to collapse, and the world's markets will go with it, likely by winter. This prediction would not come to pass.\n\nAlex's need to stoke people's fear is very extreme today, and on multiple occasions, he predicts that the \"Globalists\" are probably going to nuke someone soon, because they feel their grip on power slipping. He speculates that they are going to nuke a US city to distract from himself or Drudge getting assassinated. Just a few more predictions that did not come to pass.\n\nBeyond that, Alex spends a fair amount of time spouting pro-Assad positions, and building up his narrative that Assad had made a deal with Russia and our military (behind Obama's back) to take out ISIS, at which point Assad would step down and head to retirement in the UK. None of this is based in reality, and really is just another example of Alex Jones mirroring the Russian version of geopolitical positions.\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/8/13/august-13-2015 August 13, 2015]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Rev. Clenard Childress''': Childress is a Baptist preacher who also runs a website called BlackGenocide.com. His main area of focus is that abortion is intentionally used as a means of black genocide, which is a bold claim that never really gets defended. Abortion rates in every demographic group has been decreasing for decades, but the trends do show that the deciding factors that make abortion rates higher in some communities are systemic: financial inequality, unequal access to regular health care, the rise of abstinence only education, etc. Alex mostly has Childress on to provide cover for him to say things like \"I've seen more racist black people than white people.\"\n*'''Wayne Madsen''': Madsen is an investigative reporter who seems to have a particular interest in hating the Clintons and saying that Mossad is behind pretty much every tragedy in the world, from 9/11, to the murders carried out by Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik. Since 2015, Wayne and Alex have had a falling out, with Wayne tweeting out that Alex is a \"bloated lying shitbag.\" He has also recently taken to tweeting very anti-Trump stuff, and retweeting Alex Jones' ex-wife's tweets about how Alex is a racist.\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1521052612839-J4L3TYUGWXIZ5H7QWN4T/madsen.JPG|thumb|none]]\n\n*'''Harry Dent''': Very dicey economic expert. Harry Dent frequently appears on Alex's show, suspiciously almost always to make claims about how financial collapse is right around the corner. On today's show, he says, \"we are probably a week away from a complete collapse.\" Spoiler alert: this prediction did not come to pass. Dent is using very irresponsible rhetoric on a show that is broadcast by a gold sales company, with a host who is constantly telling his audience that they need to buy gold to be safe when the economy collapses (as Alex does many times on this episode).\n\n===Narratives===\n\nA whole lot of this episode is functionally a long infomercial for people to buy gold. It comes up repeatedly, and Harry Dent's appearance exists almost exclusively to facilitate Alex's sales pitch. This is the content of the show being led by the advertising, specifically for Genesis Communications Network's parent company Midas Resources, a gold and precious metals company. It is disgraceful, and should tell you everything you need to know about Alex's integrity.\n\nPast this, Alex spends a lot of time trying to tie the idea of abortion to black genocide, and gets very weird about the fact that he has admitted on air that he's paid for multiple abortions in the past.\n\nAs for the 2016 election, here is Alex's position as of August 13th:\n\n*Alex has an African-American guest, so he says \"Ben Carson would be a real black president\"\n*Alex says that maybe Trump could save the world, but he's been in with the \"Globalists\" for his whole life, and says that he \"smells a big rat.\"\n*Alex still supports Rand Paul for President, but would be fine if Carson won.\n\nBeyond all that, Alex asserts that \"Russia hasn't done anything to anyone\" as it relates to Ukraine (Alex says it's all George Soros' fault), and Alex claims that NAMBLA is a federally recognized non-profit (it is not, in fact there are strong indications that NAMBLA doesn't even really exist anymore as a centralized organization).\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2015/8/14/august-14-2015 August 14, 2015]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*None\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThis episode is pretty all over the place. Alex seems to be in a bit of a manic phase, so he jumps around from topic to topic without a real central thesis, other than Alex's perceived importance in the world.\n\nHe goes on a very troubling unhinged rant about how he will never sell out, which is incredibly hilarious considering he is mere months away from turning himself into a full-on propagandist for Donald Trump, and that at the end of this episode, he calls Trump a \"casino-owning shark\" and a \"slumlord.\"\n\nAlex goes on to read a review of his product Brainforce that accidentally suggests that it may be very bad for you to take. The reviewer says that they didn't really notice much of an effect until they stopped taking Brainforce, at which point they felt a lot worse and assumed they must have been feeling great before because of the Brainforce. This is strongly indicative that the supplement may cause a dependence, or that it is at least dangerous enough to cause a withdrawl.\n\nAlex voices support for the \"constitutionalists\" and \"sovereign citizens,\" claiming that they aren't doing anything wrong or violent, then has to double back and admit that they kill multiple cops every year.\n\nThis show is really inconsequential until the show reaches the Overdrive section, at which point an out-and-out white supremacist calls in. The caller claims that \"diversity\" just means \"white genocide,\" which is absolutely in line with Alex's world view, but he doesn't want to hear it mirrored back to him from a literal white supremacist.\n\nThe caller is a fan of David Duke, and insists that Alex needs to have Duke on for an interview, most likely because on some level, he suspects that Alex would realize that he agrees with Duke on pretty much everything. After about 10 minutes of Alex trying to deflect the caller's insistence that he should talk to Duke, Alex kind of freaks out about how everyone thinks he's Jewish.\n\nAlex does not know how to handle this situation because he cannot agree with the caller, but he knows that he will lose a large portion of his base if he attacks white supremacy or antisemitism directly, so he waffles in the middle. \"I'm not antisemitic, but there are so many bad Jews in the New World Order,\" is the sort of line he tries to take.\n\nIt's a very sad display, especially knowing that, within a week, Alex would have David Duke on the show for a very unsettling interview.\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/14/august-16-2015 August 16, 2015]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*None\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThis Sunday episode is a very important moment in Alex Jones' journey toward joining the Trump bandwagon as their most desperate, self-contradictory propagandist.\n\nUp until this point, Alex has been saying that he has high level sources that have told him that Trump is a \"front man for consortiums on the East Coast,\" and that Trump is deeply connected to the mob. Alex has said that it is a very real possibility that Trump is being blackmailed into running for president to destroy the Republican party, and that he is probably a \"Globalist\"/Hillary shill. He does like that Trump is anti-vaccination and that he wants to shut down immigration, but Alex has been steadfast that his allegiance lies with Rand Paul.\n\nAnd then, on this show, he starts the show by saying that \"he may have been wrong\" about Trump. Almost certainly, what this means is that Alex has started communicating with Roger Stone behind the scenes, and Roger has started spinning his web.\n\nWhether you believe that Roger quit the campaign or he was fired, [https://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/sources-roger-stone-quit-wasnt-fired-by-donald-trump-in-campaign-shakeup-121177 he had left his role as Trump's top campaign adviser a week prior]. Stone [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roger-stone-sam-nunberg-protect-dont-require-protection/story?id=53567858 would later say]:\n\n<blockquote>\"I continue to maintain that I resigned. I reached the conclusion that Donald Trump would be his own strategist...I also came to the conclusion that I could be more effective on his behalf outside the campaign.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nIt is our feeling that the way he decided he could be more effective on Trump's behalf outside the campaign is to enlist the support of a man he met two years prior at a JFK convention, Alex Jones.\n\nAlex's tone changes very drastically, and the timing of it all seems very questionable. Where he previously called Trump's behavior \"narcissistic,\" he now describes the same behavior as \"masculine,\" one of the highest compliments Alex can give someone.\n\nHe is not fully on board with Trump yet, but it is very clear from this episode that this was when his defenses began to drop. The most fascinating thing, however, is that his audience is still operating on his original talking points, so almost all of the callers parrot back his old lines like \"Trump is a Clinton shill,\" and Alex has a difficult time debating his recent rhetoric with his new perspective.\n\nAlso, on this episode, we learn that Super Male Vitality is absolutely about getting erections. Alex claims it's stronger than Viagra.\n"

Larry has an elaborate back-story about being a commercial jingle writer who was enlisted to run things in Nicaragua during Iran-Contra and then was responsible for Bill Clinton being elected as the governor of Arkansas. His timeline makes no sense whatsoever, and he's probably making most of it up. Alex Jones calls up Larry Nichols whenever he needs someone to get creative about bashing the Clintons, and Larry calls up Alex whenever he needs to ask Alex's audience to send money to him by literally giving out his real phone number and address on air. We've called him a couple times.\n*'''Gerald Celente''': \"Trends forecaster.\" Celente is, much like all of Alex's \"financial guests\" like Harry Dent or Peter Schiff, only on the show to spread pessimism and dread about the state of the economy. Though the numbers look good, don't trust them! He has a rich history of predicting market collapses on Alex's show, and then they never happen.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAlex begins the episode by clarifying his remarks from Sunday. He could probably tell that his audience was going to take a little longer to get used to the idea of supporting Trump, based on the overwhelmingly negative calls he received on the topic, so he says he is not endorsing him, but he won't be a cynic either. He is sure that \"something big\" is happening, which is basically elementary psychological conditioning being employed on the audience to prime them for this big thing that Alex can reveal when he feels the time is right.\n\nPredictably, he gets into some anti-Hillary talk, but the particular flavor of it is pretty weird. Alex seems to feel profoundly threatened by Hillary's ability to work in male-dominated fields and wear clothes that are traditionally masculine. This clip begins with him discussing that in a very stupid way, then he expresses that Putin rules Russia \"with straighshooting and high approval ratings.\"\n\nAlex is mad that people are criticizing a sorority for putting out an ad that is very conspicuous in its lacking of any non-white people. His response is that there are black fraternities and sororities and no one complains, but does not address the reality that those black fraternities and sororities were created because the white ones had \"no black member\" rules. Nor does he realize that \"historically African-American Greek organizations\" generally do not have discriminatory policies about membership, and often have white members. Greek organizations that are all white are generally the product of systemic exclusion, whereas historically black Greek organizations are a way a disenfranchised community dealt with that exclusion.\n\nRegardless of how stupid his point his, his plan to go try to antagonize people at \"black bars\" is even stupider. He goes from there and gets stupider still by bringing in his feelings about feminists and \"Mexican barbecues\" into the equation. This is two minutes of complete idiocy.\n\nNot to be outdone, Larry Nichols shows up to talk to Alex about various anti-Clinton narratives. He tells Alex that he has definitive proof that the Clintons killed Vince Foster, and when Alex tries to subtly imply that Larry won't say where he got the proof to protect his source, Larry blurts out that it just showed up in his mailbox. This is very suspicious, considering that he goes on national radio shows and gives out his home address to thousands and thousands of people on a regular basis.\n\nThe insanity gets deeper, however, when Larry reveals that he believes that President Obama is setting up the Clintons to fall because he wants to stay president, and the Clintons are the only people strong enough to stop them.\n\nLarry thinks that due to some bullshit he's cooked up about the \"FEMA provisional government,\" before the 2016 election can happen, Obama will declare a state of emergency and cancel the election, thus installing the provisional government, but this state will never end, and thus Obama will be president for life.\n\nIt gets crazier. Larry believes that if you are president when things all fall apart, you automatically become King, and if you are in Congress, you become a Duke (or Duchess). When we talked to him on the phone, we asked him to elaborate on this, but he refused to do so.\n\nLarry further asserts that when Obama becomes the Last President, and therefore King, he will reveal that he was a secret Muslim all along and merge with Islam to turn the US into a caliphate. In order to achieve his plans, Larry believes that Obama has enlisted Trump to take out the last people that stand in his way, the Clintons.\n\nThese are the utter ravings of a madman.\n\nGerald Celente's appearance is way less interesting. He is just there to do his usual thing and predict economic collapse, specifically \"by the end of the year.\" To prepare for this, of course you should buy gold, and...damnedest thing, this show is being broadcast by Genesis Communications Network, which is the media arm of a company that sells gold, Midas Resources. Probably a coincidence.\n",

So many days where he showed up at his studio expecting things to go one way, only for them to go completely wrong.\n\nNo embarrassing moment could ever top the outright tragedy of his \"debate\" with former Klan member and avowed white supremacist David Duke. The whole thing is just a disaster of Alex trying to pretend that he doesn't agree with Duke, and you can watch the whole thing below.\n\nThroughout the entire \"debate,\" David Duke has to keep reminding Alex that Alex agreed to let him talk, clearly indicating that Duke agreed to appear on his terms and Alex agreed to them. David Duke is clearly in the power position: he can walk at any time, but Alex needs him.\n\nAlex had received calls in recent days from David Duke fans arguing that they would agree, and Alex desperately needs Duke to be there so he can try to demonstrate that he doesn't believe the same things as this out-and-out antisemite and bigot.\n\nThis \"debate\" is a damning document of the time when Alex Jones accidentally invited the living embodiment of his rhetoric onto his show and tried to argue with it, only to end up with a headache when it became clear that he was looking into a mirror. Their only real disagreements were minor semantic matters, which is just outrageous.\n\nWe did an episode of the podcast breaking all this down, so please feel free to listen to it below. I would prefer not to write any more about David Duke than I have to.\n"

      "'''What Was Fun About This Episode'''<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2013/4/1/april-1-2013 April 1, 2013]</ref>\n\nThroughout most of the show, Alex Jones tells a story about his recent vacation.\n\nAs the story goes, he went to a resort with his family, and while he was in the hot tub one day, he struck up a conversation with a couple fellow bathers who happened to be listeners of his show. As they're talking about the importance of liberty, another individual overhears them, and stands up to defend the \"Globalists.\" This man is described as an authoritarian who may be a government scientist, in the field of viruses.\n\nThe story is outlandish, just based on the preliminary details, but it becomes even more suspicious, as Alex tells the story over and over and the details keep kind of shifting.\n\nHe would go on to tell the story again on the April 2nd episode of his show, and the details had changed even more. All in all, we do not believe this happened at all, but definitely enjoy Alex's flair for the dramatic, and his ability to create stories of himself being a victim.\n\n'''Did Anything Important Happen On This Show?'''\n\nSteve Piezchenik comes on the show and tells Alex about his belief that Sandy Hook was a false flag. All of the theories he proposes, such as \"all of the family members are crisis actors,\" have been pretty roundly discredited and dismissed, but Steve believes them.\n\nThe reason he begins with in his thesis that Sandy Hook was fake is even more embarrassing though:\n\nHe believes that, because Susan Collins both wrote the Hunger Games and is from Sandy Hook, CT, that the two facts are related. He says that the shooting was \"straight out of the Hunger Games,\" which it is really not. There is the thinnest thematic similarity in that school kids were victims, but beyond that, there's not much holding this theory together.\n\nEveryone knows that the Hunger Games is very clearly ripped off of the 2000 Kinji Fukasaku film Battle Royale, with a little dusting of the adolescent literature genre staples on top.\n\nBeyond that, not much important happened on this episode. Alex takes some uneventful calls and rambles a little bit about how he has terror visions of patriots being sent to FEMA camps, but that pretty much would describe every episode of the show.\n"

Alex Jones and Marrs talk a lot about how Sirhan Sirhan is a patsy and that Robert Kennedy was killed by the CIA. Whenever Marrs is on, Alex just talks about how he is a researcher into JFK and RFK conspiracy theories, but never really mentions that he's written such books as \"Alien Agenda: Investigating the Extraterrestrial Presence Among Us,\" and \"Our Occulted History: Do the Global Elite Conceal Ancient Aliens?\" Also, beginning in 2011, Jim Marrs hosted a radio show called The View From Marrs on the Rense Radio Network, a network that also broadcast David Duke's radio show, so there are some questions about his judgement.\n*'''Yukihisa Fujita''': A member of the Democratic Party of Japan in the House of Councillors. Fujita is appearing on Alex's show because he had recently come out in support of the 9/11 Truther community. This is something of an ouroboros, however, as [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2008/06/17/issues/lawmaker-takes-911-doubts-global/#.WqVw7q6nHIV in another interview], Fujita said that he had doubts about 9/11 from watching the film Loose Change, which was produced by Alex Jones. Alex's film created the doubts in Fujita, then Fujita appears on Alex's show to parrot back the same things that Alex put in his film, and Alex gets to elevate his narratives because they are being repeated by a foreign politician.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nBecause of the Jim Marrs interview, a lot of Alex's attention on today's show is taken up by talking about the RFK assassination, and accepting as concrete fact that the \"Globalists\" took him out. He then extends this to 9/11 and acts as if these two things are absolutely connected.\n\nMost of the show is just a standard, kind of boring Alex Jones broadcast from this era.\n\n===Notable Calls===\n\n*A caller who identifies himself as a \"Chemtrail Blogger\" calls in to tell a long story about how he was pretty convinced that helicopters were coming to get him, or at very least were stalking him. Alex does nothing to point out to this guy that what he is experiencing is most likely a manifestation of unchecked paranoia, which is incredibly irresponsible.\n*A caller suggests to Alex that the best way to change the world would be to get all the big name celebrities who don't believe the mainstream story about 9/11 together for some kind of a \"9/11 Truth Woodstock.\" Alex's response is that \"only I could get all the celebrities\" to put this together, and that he is not going to put in the kind of effort it would take to do that.\n\nAlso of note is that this episode includes a couple runs of a commercial advertising tourism to Israel and a company called Go Israel.\n\nThis is a slight indication that, at this point, Alex and/or Ted Anderson (through Genesis Communication Network) was accepting advertising money from Israel, seeing as Go Israel is run by the Ministry of Tourism of the Government of Israel.\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1520793163426-20GLCPKD0O14557TFCP2/goisrael.JPG|thumb|none]]\n\nIn no way does this prove that Alex is an Israeli agent (as many of his critics claim), just that in 2008, ad revenue was coming into the operation from the Israeli government.\n"

      "Finally, Alex is back from \"vacation,\" and he comes out of the box hot.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/12/march-12-2018 March 12, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Tommy Robinson''': Noted anti-Muslim agitator, and career criminal ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130313170714/http://news.sky.com/story/1034468/edl-leader-lennon-jailed-for-passport-offence convicted for having a fake passport in 2012], [http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-25110639 sentenced to 18 months in prison for mortgage fraud in 2014], to name a few crimes). Tommy Robinson, whose real name appears to be Stephen Lennon, is on the show in an attempt to save face because a video came out over the weekend of him getting punched in the face in a McDonalds parking lot. The interview is largely about how he actually was the victim of a coordinated attack (by Antifa?) and that he actually won the fight. It's a fascinating mix of Tommy trying to preserve his masculinity, while at the same time, trying to firmly establish his claim to being a victim. Basically, he's right on the InfoWars wavelength.\n*'''Mike Adams''': \"The Health Ranger\" and proprietor of Natural News, one of the world's most popular \"health conspiracy\" websites. Most of his interview has to do with how his YouTube channel got taken down recently. It's really a meaningless interview, since YouTube is well within their rights to do that, so I don't really care. Mike is starting a new video hosting website, I think. I wish him the best of luck with that endeavor.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nA large portion of today's show involves Alex going on unhinged rants about how the enemies he imagines he is up against are literally Satanic, and they want to kill your children. He keeps telling a very clearly fictitious story from his \"vacation\" wherein he is verbally assaulted by two gay men at the airport who (he claims) are offended by the fact that he has a family. Conveniently, he didn't get any of this on tape, particularly the part where these men try to start a fight with Alex's 15 year old son.\n\nAlex's interview with Tommy Robinson takes up about an hour of the show, and is really just Tommy making sure everyone remembers that he's a big boy and good at fighting, interspersed with occasional yelling about Muslims. At one point, Alex says that Tommy is \"the greatest patriot\" alive today, which should be a strong indication that when Alex talks about \"patriotism,\" he's not talking about a connection to one's country,. He probably uses the term to mean more of an ethnicity-based allegiance that he feels. This is incredibly troubling.\n\nAlex has some interesting ideas about history on this episode, and he says a few things I have not heard him say before. For instance, he says that the original \"Globalist traitor\" was Harry S. Truman and that Alex wishes that General McArthur had carried out a military coup back then. This is nuts to hear someone who is supposedly for democratic government say, as generally speaking, military coups rarely lead to stability and acquiescence of power.\n\nIt is interesting to note, however, that neo-Nazis are really not into President Truman, and may think of him as a traitor as well (a \"race traitor\"), because he ended WW2, which led to the collapse of the Third Reich, and the creation of the state of Israel. Strange all the little parallels Alex's worldview has with Nazis. Probably a coincidence.\n\nThe only other main point on this episode is that it happens just as news is breaking that there was a bombing in Austin, the third in the month, and the second that day. As I am writing this, the case is still open and details are scarce, but Alex spent most of the show trying to work himself up to saying that Antifa did it. He keeps saying, \"I'm not saying it was Antifa, but this looks like a commie bombing,\" over and over.\n\nLate in the show, one of Alex's interns actually slips him a story about the bombings, and he accidentally reads that all the targets of the attacks have been African-Americans, and he is forced to concede, \"I have no idea what's going on here.\" I, for one, could stand to hear him say that more often.\n\nWe did an episode of the podcast about March 12, 2018, which you can listen to below:\n"

A lot of her interview is taken up by Alex complaining about how he's getting sued, and trying to loosely connect his perceived plight to Brittany's perceived plight. It's a largely uninspired showing, and full of weak strawman arguments about their oppression.\n*'''Lee Stranahan''': Lee is a journalist who is being sued along with Alex Jones. Lee Stranahan used to write for Brietbart, but quit in protest, and began working for Sputnik, which is a state-owned Russian media outlet. [http://thehill.com/homenews/media/327559-former-breitbart-reporter-joins-russian-propaganda-network-im-on-the-russian When asked about the situation], he said: \"I'm on the Russian payroll now. When you work at Sputnik you're being paid by the Russians.\" After the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, VA, Lee Stranahan went on InfoWars and other outlets to claim a connection between the rally and George Soros, arguing that this was a repeat of what \"the Globalists\" did in Ukraine (mirroring the Russian government's position that they were the \"good guys\" in Ukraine). The interview on today's show is pretty boring, and mostly just serves to further Alex's dishonest take on the new lawsuit filed against him (more on that below).\n*'''Paul Joseph Watson''' hosted the 4th Hour, so I turned it off. I assume he continued the broadcast complaining about being persecuted.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThe first hour of the show today was dedicated almost entirely to Alex going through his slow transformation into \"Late Lenny Bruce Mode,\" where his show is now becoming more and more Alex complaining about his perceived victimhood. The difference is that Lenny Bruce was standing up for free speech, whereas Alex is just witnessing the inevitable end result of his years of terrible behavior and spreading propaganda.\n\nAlex is claiming that six of the eleven lawsuits that have been filed against him have been dismissed \"with prejudice.\" There is no way to confirm any of this, and there is a decent chance that Alex is just making up additional imaginary lawsuits to claim were dismissed to strengthen the perception of his position.\n\n[http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/378099-virginia-man-sues-infowars-others-for-fake-news-after The new lawsuit] that he is discussing today is being brought against him by Brennan Gilmore, the person who recorded the video of Heather Heyer being murdered by a Nazi at the Charlottesville rally. Gilmore alleges that incendiary \"reporting\" carried out by Alex Jones (among others, also listed in the lawsuit) led to him being the target of harrassment and violent threats.\n\nAlex's spin on this is to say that he is being sued by \"the Jesuits,\" Pope Francis, and the \"deepest part of the deep state,\" because the lawsuit was filed by the Georgetown Law School's Civil Rights Clinic. Alex thinks, or is at least pretending that he thinks, that this means that Georgetown itself is suing him.\n\nThis could not be further from the truth. If you look into the [https://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/civil-rights-clinic/index.cfm Civil Rights Clinic], you will find out what this organization actually is:\n\n<blockquote>\"The Civil Rights Clinic operates as a public interest law firm, representing individual clients and other public interest organizations, primarily in the areas of discrimination and constitutional rights, workplace fairness, and open government... Students interview clients, develop case theories, draft and file complaints in state and federal courts, conduct discovery, engage in motions practice, and prepare appeals.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nThe Civil Rights Clinic is basically the equivalent of psychology students that take on clients to earn course credit and gain experience, while simultaneously allowing patients with less resources access to mental health care. The Civil Rights Clinic just does that same kind of thing, but with law students.\n\nSo why Georgetown? Probably because it's one of the largest colleges with a very good legal department, that is a two-hour drive from Charlottesville, Virginia. It's not really not that suspicious at all, and is just another case of Alex trying to create a fake version of reality to attack as opposed to dealing with what is actually going on.\n\nThe twisting of this narrative takes up pretty much the entire program, with Alex weaving in constant reminders that the only way he's going to survive this \"Globalist attack\" is if everyone out there sends him money. Pretty par for the InfoWars course.\n\nAlex briefly touches on today's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and plays a little bit of Tillerson's press conference. Alex says that everything Tillerson is saying is \"code\" and that it is probably a \"message to the Globalist stay-behind networks.\" He does not elaborate on this absurd theory any further.\n",

Alex keeps accidentally calling Scott \"Dilbert,\" then immediately correcting himself. Scott Adams comments a bit on last night's PA special election, suggesting that Lamb will likely win because \"he is the candidate that reminds people most of Trump.\" He also explains that people shouldn't care about students walking out of schools to protest our lack of gun laws because young people are the \"dumbest people in society.\" Strong showing from Dilbert.\n*'''Roger Stone''': Very boring appearance from Roger where he and Alex play the victim about lawsuits being filed against them. Alex tries to rally Roger to \"get back on the offensive,\" but neither of them really has the energy to do so.\n*'''Gavin McInness''': Failed stand up and leader of a completely idiotic definitely not white nationalist (but kinda white nationalist) fraternity called The Proud Boys. Whenever Gavin is on the show, he wastes most of his time doing incredibly hacky stand up bits about feminism, gay people, or \"the leftists\" that would not pass muster at an open mic. His showing today is particularly pathetic, and he repeatedly says that George Soros \"led Nazis to Jews,\" which is something he can in no way prove. Then, he gets mad that people think that \"Globalist\" is a dog-whistle for Jews, when [https://knowledgefight.com/business/2017/11/22/djvemu6u8gy2kjkmsv33xnwwmpy1nu it absolutely is]. Then, he and Alex spout a bunch of dumb theories about lesbians and about how liberals just want to be mad at \"daddy,\" who I guess is supposed to be represented by these two assholes.\n*'''Steve Pieczenik''': It appears that Steve is on the show today to make sure that Alex does not get suspicious about the CIA Director being made the new Secretary of State. Alex does constantly accuse the CIA of being part of the Deep State, so there would be cause for concern that he might look at this as a coup. Steve is a fan of Mike Pompeo (who is also a Koch favorite), and wants to make sure that Alex doesn't start pushing back against him. Also, he repeatedly calls George Soros a \"Jew rat.\"\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAs has been the theme lately, most of this show is about how Alex is the victim of a coordinated attack, carried out by (if you believe Alex's version) the Pope, the Jesuits, Georgetown University, George Soros, the \"Globalists,\" the Deep State, Hillary's former top lawyer, Michael Jackson's lawyer, and the entirety of the Democratic party. He spends almost the whole first hour complaining about fake versions of the lawsuits against him, and telling his audience that they need to give him money.\n\nHe takes the narrative up to a whole new level today, going so far as to say that if the people suing him are successful, it will be the end of the 1st amendment.\n\nIgnore for a minute that the result of a civil trial can in no way set a precedent that would undo an amendment to the constitution. Ignore for a second that the only way to repeal an amendment to the constitution is to pass a new amendment to the constitution, which would require support of 2/3 of the members of Congress, and then need to be voted in by 3/4 of the states. Ignore for a moment that if this ruling of the judge in Alex's civil trial did conflict with the 1st amendment, all he would need to do would be to appeal the ruling and demonstrate that his rights were violated. Ignore for a little bit that the 1st amendment covers substantially more than \"free speech,\" and in no way could this case do anything to any of that. Please keep ignoring these very basic truths, it's much more fun to just hear Alex yell.\n\nIn reality, he has been skating by narrowly avoiding libel and slander suits for his entire career, and this is the end result, the chickens coming home to roost. Ultimately, he's begging the audience for money because he knows he's going to settle all of these lawsuits out of court and take a big hit, rather than risk what could come out if he had to defend any of his positions under oath. It's a pathetic display, and we can expect a whole lot more of it in the days to come.\n\nIn another interesting development, Alex Jones is now seemingly trying to get himself involved in lawsuits that aren't being brought against him. [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/seth-rich-parents-lawsuit-fox-news/ Seth Rich's parents have filed a suit] against Fox News, Malia Zimmerman, and Ed Butowsky for creating and pushing a false story about their son's death that has caused them considerable harm. Due to the contents of emails that have come out from Butowsky showing a clear conspiracy to push the story in an effort to clear the Russians of the accusation of hacking DNC servers, it will probably be a successful suit.\n\nAlex is pretending that the Rich's lawsuit is just them suing Fox News for \"investigating\" their son's murder. He is trying to pitch the narrative that people like Sean Hannity care more about finding the truth about Seth's murder than his parents do, which is a line so disgusting it is hard to find a suitable thing to compare it to.\n\nAlex spends a bit of the show talking about how Seth Rich was murdered, and was behind the DNC hacks, because he knows that the material claim of this lawsuit is not about people spreading lies about Seth Rich; it is about the very clear conspiracy behind the scenes at Fox News to use his tragic death as a prop to defend Trump and Russia.\n\nOther than that, the only part of the show that merits further mention is how awful and not funny Gavin McInness is. He has about a half-hour segment, and he spends most of the beginning of it accusing George Soros of having led Nazis to Jews, leading to their \"extermination.\"\n\nI've already [https://knowledgefight.com/lie-files/2017/3/18/george-soros-helped-the-nazis-round-up-jews-in-the-holocaust written about this lie in detail here], so I won't bore the reader again. In reality, Gavin isn't upset about Soros, he's only bringing this up because he is all triggered about a lot of people calling his Nazi friends Nazis, all the while, it seems like only his Nazi friends are the ones calling George Soros a Nazi. It just doesn't make sense!\n\nGavin goes on to explain a very interesting theory about lesbians:\n\nHe seems to be operating under a couple of really fucked up assumptions:\n\n*Only gay people give birth to gay children\n*This is the first generation where lesbians have existed, and since they are not reproducing, there will be none next generation\n*A person's value to society is largely based on their reproductive ability\n\nHe believes the first two because he's a homophobic idiot and because he probably thinks he's being funny. He believes that third one because he is mad at white people who do not breed, as he thinks that other cultures are going to \"breed white people out of existence.\" These are your standard white genocide narratives, and they're not made any more convincing when you just swap out the word \"white\" with \"Western.\"\n\nAlex and Gavin go on to do some hacky two-man stand up routine, tossing around stupid stereotypes about gay men and lesbians:\n\nAs fun as it would be to go through this point by point, it's clear that Gavin presents himself as both a comedian and as a political commentator because he is terrible at both things. However, by pretending to be both, when a joke doesn't land, he can claim he was making a serious point. Conversely, when someone calls him out for being a complete idiot and a bigot, he can go the Coward's Route and claim he was just joking, and that you're so triggered that you don't get his humor. It's a pathetic game his community plays to dodge any responsibility for the things they say, or how unfunny they are.\n\nOn this show, Alex also claims to have received inside information about the bombings in Austin. He claims it came directly from law enforcement that the bombs are amateur in nature, and may not look like a normal package. These are things that anyone could probably deduce. The part that is interesting about Alex's claim, however, is that he says that his source told him that the bombs are made on the doorstep where they are left, which seems like a completely inefficient plan for a bomber to utilize as it would leave them pretty exposed while they were assembling the bomb. Seems very dumb. When the facts of the case come out, we will see, but in the meantime, I will register that this does not sound real to me.\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/15/march-15-2018 March 15, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Bill Mitchell''': Bill is a Trump supporter and guy with radio show on Periscope. Bill comes on the show today to spin some very far-out theories about what is really going on with Jeff Sessions, and that somehow Trump had flipped Mueller behind the scenes. As Bill and Alex were having this conversation, news broke that Mueller had subpoenaed records relating to Russia from Trump's businesses.\n*'''Ted Malloch''': Ted is Alex's go-to guy when he wants to give the air of authenticity to his narratives about the \"Globalists,\" because as he claims, Ted is a \"Globalist insider,\" having been involved with The Aspen Institute. Unfortunately, it turns out that Ted has a pretty troubling [https://www.ft.com/content/d1b0453a-fde0-11e6-8d8e-a5e3738f9ae4 history of] [https://www.ft.com/content/239d378e-ee20-11e6-ba01-119a44939bb6 being a] [https://www.ft.com/content/ce317948-efbb-11e6-930f-061b01e23655 public liar]. As is so often the case with Alex Jones guests, Ted Malloch is another con man who has run out of places to run the grift, and has ended up at the end of the line: InfoWars.\n\nNarratives:\n\nA lot of today's show is spent getting into some real weird Doomsday Preacher style antics, about how the end times are upon us. He is getting esoteric all over the place, rambling about how human brains somehow involve an interdimensional \"jump gate\" that allows people to see the future. From anyone else, this sort of language would be troubling and evidence of a brain tumor, but from Alex, it's very clear that what it means is that he has no take on the news and needs to fill time.\n\nAlex cites a speech by Niall Ferguson to make an argument that the technological elite will end up deciding elections in the future. Alex never wrestles with the fact that Ferguson is a guy who wrote an authorized biography (which has been described as \"fawning\") about Alex's arch-rival, and guy Alex thinks want's to kill 80% of the population, Henry Kissinger. He also doesn't deal with Ferguson's history of support for the Iraq War, and his push for America to embrace its empire. Instead of dealing with Ferguson's comments within the Neocon context in which they were spoken, Alex just calls him a \"leading historian\" and moves on.\n\nHe moves on to lamenting that a \"slightly right wing organization\" was getting cracked down on in the UK. He doesn't spend much time talking about this organization, which is probably for the best, since it's Britain First, which is a fascist group that exists specifically to harass and threaten Muslims in England. Their history is a huge bigoted mess, so it makes good sense that Alex supports them and wants to present them as victims. Because they are white.\n\nOn that tip, he goes on to rant about how 90%+ of public racism (cross burnings, for example) are fake and just psyops to make minorities look like victims. He also says that \"the Democrats\" were the trouble-makers in Charlottesville, which is an interesting argument, considering that literal Nazis were also right there on the table as possible people to call \"trouble makers.\"\n\nBy this point, Alex has heard about the start-up Nectome, who has come out and said that they can upload your brain but you have to euthanized first. Alex believes that this is proof of his arguments that transhumanism is just trying to kill you and that he's been right all along.\n\nLeave aside the companies such as Alcor Life Extension Foundation, who currently hold over 150 heads and bodies in stasis in liquid nitrogen (including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Williams baseball great Ted Williams]) with the idea of transferring them into new bodies or computers once the technology is developed. Alcor has been around since 1972. Tons of other life-extension companies along this line exist and have for decades.\n\nPast that, the part about people being euthanized is specifically a reference to the California End of Life Option Act, wherein people who have been diagnosed with terminal conditions are able to choose a physician assisted suicide to spare them the dignity of dying on their own terms. The conversation that Nectome is having about their process is specifically being had in that context, which Alex does not address.\n\nAlex's analysis of this is incredibly shallow and stupid, and in no way based in reality.\n\nThe only other really meaningful thing that happens on this episode is that Bill Mitchell convinces Alex that it is possible that Mueller has investigated Trump and decided that Trump didn't commit any crimes, so now the two have teamed up and were about to take down Hillary. Mitchell tells Alex (and Alex later repeats) the conjecture that Jeff Sessions is playing possum and laying low, waiting to spring these indictments against Hillary at the right time to swing the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nNow, some would say that \"manipulatively using the legal system to persecute your political rivals in order to boost your party's public support\" seems the exact sort of thing a dictator who is afraid of the will of the people might do, but in this case, Bill and Alex think it's a brilliant strategy. What a couple of unprincipled cowards.\n"

      "Though Alex Jones does not do a show on Saturdays generally, on March 17th he decided to pop down to the studio and record a 24-minute special report, basically about nothing.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/17/march-17-2018 March 17, 2018]</ref>\n\nIt is St. Patrick's Day weekend, and Alex definitely seems a little drunk. He has the trademark \"way-too-long pauses\" going, he gets vaguely esoteric at points for no reason, he has no ability to stay focused on any topic for more than a fleeting second, oh, and of course, he produces a Dixie cup from underneath his table and drinks from it long and hard, in a way few of us have ever drank water:\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1521396658623-9BQ3RQOK6M8X26XI5QVN/drink1.JPG|thumb|none]]\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1521396678943-62NJ5YICYTVDWDQ0JEHH/drink2.JPG|thumb|none]]\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1521396697258-44JNMF2R3YQVY50I7S0A/drink3.JPG|thumb|none]]\n\nThe title of the video is \"Hillary About To Be Indicted After McCabe Firing,\" but in reality, that topic is only briefly touched on. Instead, Alex goes on long jags about how he \"follows his gut\" now more than ever, and that's led him to criticize Trump lately, and he regrets it, because Trump is just so great.\n\nAlex expounds on some of his normal talking points, like how he \"never says that we are close to victory,\" but that this time the \"Patriots\" are super close to victory. For those not paying attention, the only think Alex does more than awkwardly throw to an on-air commercial is say that his side is \"''this close''\" to winning (and that if you \"flood him with cash,\" he will destroy the \"Globalists\").\n\nThere's some requisite stroking of Alex's ego along the way, where he tells his listeners that the very high end Generals and military leaders call him and ask, \"Alex, what do we do? We need you to be our leader.\" Of course, Alex follows this up by making sure you don't think he's bragging.\n\nAll in all, it's a very standard \"Special Report.\" Alex is drunk/drinking, he thinks he's going to cover one thing, but he ends up rambling about literally anything else, and, in the end, all that's really achieved is Alex gets to put out a salaciously titled video to get some extra eyes on his pill commercials.\n"

      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/20/march-20-2018 March 20, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Mark Meechan''': Meechan is an idiot from the UK who got in trouble because he posted a video of himself training his dog to give a Hitler Salute when he said \"Sieg Heil\" or \"gas the Jews.\" The same day he is appearing on InfoWars, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pug-nazi-salute-youtube-video-owner-guilty-hate-crime-mark-meechan-lanarkshire-a8265301.html he was found guilty in a Scottish court of having committed a hate crime]. The issue is that in the UK, \"the first amendment\" as we understand it does not exist, and if you say things that are intentionally inflammatory, you can be held accountable for the results of your actions, so Alex and Mark do not really have a leg to stand on. Mark's defense hinged on his insistence that he had trained his dog to do this, and made the video, to annoy his girlfriend, but that sort of implies that his girlfriend (or Mark himself) says \"Sieg Heil\" or \"gas the Jews\" enough that she would even notice. If neither of them ever said shit like that, there's no real payoff to this as a prank. Oh, also, Mark is on the show along with noted career criminal/con man/anti-Muslim agitator Tommy Robinson, so his credibility as a \"not racist person\" is in the toilet.\n*'''Alexander Nekrassov''': Nekrassov is a former (?) Kremlin presidential adviser, and has been involved with the Russian government for about the last two decades. He has a long history of writing for publications such as Al Jazeera and others about topics like how Marine Le Pen is great and it's not a problem that Russian state banks donated millions to her campaign, or how Putin is the good guy in Ukraine. He seems to have a pretty consistent messaging with state media outlets. In his interview, he literally tells Alex that when he worked for the Kremlin, he was a \"fixer,\" and his job would be to work behind the scenes. Alex does not grasp that he is being worked over by a high-level foreign government fixer live on air at any point.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThe first half-hour of the show today seems to have one goal in mind: sow doubt about the stories that are coming out about Cambridge Analytica, the data company run by Trump's former campaign manager Steve Bannon, and funded by billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer.\n\nIn the days previous to March 20, Channel 4 in the UK started revealing the results of a four month investigation into Cambridge Analytica, which included undercover recordings of their CEO Alexander Nix ([http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-cambridge-analytica-suspends-ceo-20180320-story.html who has now been suspended pending an investigation]) admitting that their techniques of getting people elected to lead countries all over the world often involved blackmail and dissemination of propaganda.\n\nThe investigation is very illuminating and calls into very serious question how badly fooled Alex was by a propaganda marketing firm. The videos show an executive explaining how he had come up with \"Crooked Hillary\" as a \"brand\" to sell, and in one of the more troubling pieces, he explains how they would get their information out:\n\n<blockquote>\"Sometimes you can use proxy organisations who are already there, you feed them...activist groups, we use them, feed them the material, and they do the work.\n\nAnd so, this stuff infiltrates the online community, and expands, but with no branding, so it's unattributable, untrackable.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\n\u2014 Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global\n\nThat sounds a lot like the beginning of a process that Alex Jones is in the middle/end of. How much he is even aware of his role, or how aware Roger Stone is of what is going on, are fascinating questions I'm excited to hear both men lie about in the coming weeks.\n\nAll the pieces of this Channel 4 investigation is worth watching, but the part I've embedded below is the portion that is most relevant to our purposes, as it deals with some things learned about Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign.\n\nThis is a major deal, and the things that are starting to come out look like they may hint to some sort of coordination of propaganda messaging in the entirety of the Trump campaign, whether Alex was privy to the coordination, or he was just a useful idiot.\n\nAlex probably doesn't know about these videos when he goes on air on March 20, because he's generally a bit behind on \"news that looks really bad for him,\" so he's probably just minimizing the revelations made by Christopher Wylie, who worked at Cambridge Analytica and [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump has recently gone public] with some troubling accusations about their data-harvesting techniques, among other concerns.\n\nWhatever the case, Alex paints the scenario as being that Facebook is the \"real bad guy,\" going so far as to suggest that the social media site was created to get you to kill yourself.\n\nIn other news, there was another bombing in Austin, and Alex is continuing to pretend that the \"inside information\" he broadcast about a week back is accurate, but in reality it has been completely refuted. Consider the following:\n\n*Alex said that his sources told him that the bomber was creating the bombs on the porches where they were left and that it takes about 20 min. We now have clear evidence of multiple of these bombs being sent by the mail, with the most recent one exploding at the FedEx center.\n*Alex clearly said that his source told him that the bombs could not be moved (hence why they were built on the porch, in broad daylight), but the bomb that killed Draylen Mason [https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/13/us/austin-explosion-packages/index.html was moved from the porch into the kitchen], where it then blew up. This literally disproves Alex's claims.\n*Alex said that his source told him that the bombs were very amateurish, and to an external observer with no fake inside sources, that seemed like a pretty good assumption back then. Time has shown that this is probably a bit more sophisticated a situation than previously thought.\n*Alex is now saying that the bombs \"are mousetraps,\" which I can't tell if he's saying as a reference to the trap for mice or a reference to the board game.\n\nHe is just making shit up as he goes along and pretending it's coming from legitimate sources, and it's amazingly embarrassing if you take the time to keep track and watch how the lies change over time when his \"inside information\" is proven to be nonsense.\n\nAlex excitedly comes back from a commercial break to announce that RT is reporting that Trump is going to meet up with Putin over concerns about \"an out-of-control arms race.\" This combines with his interview with former (?) Kremlin adviser Alexander Nekrassov about how great Putin's reelection is to create a show that is largely pushing the viewpoint of Russian state media, as opposed to an in anyway unbiased analysis of the news. This should in no way be shocking, as Alex has admitted on air that he has spoken privately with active Russian intelligence agents.\n\nAlex is a spineless sycophant, asking Nekrassov at one point, \"why do Russians love Putin so much?\"\n\nTaken in a vacuum, that is just a soft, bad question for a journalist to ask. That is the sort of question that only really leads to an answer that is propaganda, which is why it is the sort of question that Alex asks this former (?) Kremlin adviser, who openly admits on the show that he is a \"fixer.\"\n\nIf you're keeping score, Alex is running a media program, and has this former (?) Kremlin adviser on, who goes on to explain that formerly (?) his job was to intercede and fix things when Putin and the Kremlin did things that maybe didn't go over well with foreign media programs. Alex is a very dumb man.\n\nRoger Stone pops in for a little while to pitch the narrative that Jeff Sessions is mentally unfit to continue in his role as Attorney General, and Alex chimes in that he may have \"had a stroke.\" This is likely because they are aware that Sessions is probably not stupid enough to fire Mueller, and they really, really need someone to derail that investigation. If Sessions won't do it, you gotta turn on Sessions.\n\nAlex gets into a video of Congressman Nicholas Suozzi, who made some unfortunate comments in a town hall meeting that appeared to have been held at a VFW hall. Suozzi was asked what people could do if Trump continued to ignore the courts, and his response was not great: \"This is where the Second Amendment comes in quite frankly, because you know, what if the President was to ignore the courts? What would you do? What would we do?\"\n\nAlex is quick to forget that on the campaign trail, in front of a substantially larger crowd, Donald Trump said about Hillary Clinton, \"by the way, and if she gets to pick --if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know.\"\n\nStupid Alex Jones style hypocrisy aside, this comment threw Alex into a tailspin where he is now advocating on his show that it is time to have a serious conversation about politically motivated violence:\n\nThis is incredibly scary rhetoric coming from an unhinged lunatic who is doing \"spiritual battle\" with an imaginary enemy. It's even scarier that he goes on to advocate that Trump take out his political rivals, using covert means:\n\nHmmm. That makes me think of this one other guy who Alex is a big fan of who seems to like using \"covert actions\" to take out his political rivals and dissenters. What a crazy coincidence that one of that guy's former (?) advisers was a guest on Alex's show earlier.\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/21/march-21-2018 March 21, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Dr. Edward Group''': Dr. Group is not a doctor, he is a chiropractor. He has a bunch of degrees from the Natural Healing Institute of Naturopathy, which from many indications is just the sort of place where if you pay for their \"classes,\" you get a degree. He seems to think his parents may have been in the Illuminati, and claims his dad invented Saran Wrap, and that his life's work is undoing the damage his father did by \"working with plastics.\"\n*Alex and Roger Stone host the 4th Hour. It is not notable.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAlex opens the show by completely misrepresenting a story about a man who was attacked, who happened to be \"researching\" the death of Seth Rich. Alex's version of the story is that the attacked man, Jack Burkman, was somehow working in an official capacity as an investigator, and the attacker Kevin Doherty was an assassin sent to kill him for not backing down, and that he was a Marine who was involved with the Department of Energy, implying that said department was involved in the attack.\n\nIn reality, this is an instance not of a political hit-job, but a case of one crazy person offending [https://forward.com/fast-forward/397089/conspiracist-allegedly-attacked-by-man-he-hired-to-analyze-seth-richs/ another crazy person and attacking him]:\n\n<blockquote>\"Jack Burkman told The Washington Post that he had hired Kevin Doherty to help him build a psychological profile of Rich's killer...Burkman fired Doherty in July 2017 and moved on to investigating the FBI. In February, Burkman was contacted by a man who claimed to have information on then-deputy director Andrew McCabe.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nSpoiler alert: that guy who contacted him was Doherty, and he did not have info on McCabe, he had the intention of killing Burkman. One of the drawbacks of living in the world of \"conspiracy,\" especially these days, is that the people you are going to be working with are generally going to be very dangerous people who don't take rejection well.\n\nThis has nothing to do with Seth Rich's actual death, and it is absolutely disgraceful to suggest it does, without any evidence beyond that Burkman believed unfounded theories about Rich.\n\nInterestingly, one thing Alex doesn't bring up is that Jack Burkman is a Trump-connected lobbyist, [https://www.carbonated.tv/news/conservative-lobbyist-private-investigator-dnc-seth-rich-death who has raised money for Rick Gates in the past]. If you'll recall, Rick Gates is Paul Manafort's associate (and Trump campaign member) [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/30/16570580/rick-gates-guilty-plea-deal-conspiracy-against-the-united-states-paul-manafort who recently plead guilty] to lying to the FBI and \"conspiracy against the United States.\" Probably just a coincidence.\n\nAnother of Alex's large narratives he's pushing on this show is that the \"Globalists\" are about to flee to their \"armored redoubts,\" which if you have paid any attention, is a narrative Alex screams about approximately every other month. When inevitably nothing happens, he drops the narrative until a new article is written somewhere about how people like Peter Theil or Mark Zuckerburg bought a home in New Zealand or Hawaii, at which point he brings the idea back.\n\nThe story he's responding to today is [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/official-washington-flocking-to-doomsday-camps-1 from the Washington Examiner]. It's a story that you see over and over through the years when the world seems chaotic. Around Y2K, conspiracy theorists made these sorts of claims (as did Alex), after 9/11 they said the same (as did Alex), around the supposed 2012 Mayan Apocalypse, you saw many of the same articles about \"boutique survival bunker companies.\"\n\nIt's a human interest story meant to appeal to the paranoia that everyone is already feeling. The article conveniently doesn't name any of the elites that are supposedly buying up space in this guy's survival camp, Fortitude Ranch, though he claims people from \"unnamed three letter organizations\" are flocking to him. What this amounts to, because it's devoid of any real information, is a buzz-marketing puff piece for Fortitude Ranch.\n\nDr. Group drops by to talk about how the World Health Organization is warning about the possibility of a breakout of Disease X, and how he has done a lot of research into this. Alex and Group are covering this news almost as if they are trying to say that this is a specific disease, but it is not.\n\nEvery year, the WHO puts out a list of the diseases they believe could pose the biggest risk to humanity. This year, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/09/world-health-organization-issues-alert-disease-x/ they added an additional entry], Disease X, to symbolize all the potential health threats that are not on radar. It's basically the equivalent of a gambler hedging their bets by \"playing the field.\" John-Arne Rottingen, chief executive of the Research Council of Norway and a scientific adviser to the WHO committee explains it thus:\n\n<blockquote>\"History tells us that it is likely the next big outbreak will be something we have not seen before. It may seem strange to be adding an \u2018X' but the point is to make sure we prepare and plan flexibly in terms of vaccines and diagnostic tests. We want to see \u2018plug and play' platforms developed which will work for any, or a wide number of diseases; systems that will allow us to create countermeasures at speed.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nThat makes a lot of sense, but somehow Alex turns this into an argument to be anti-vaccinations because he believes that they are going to be the cause of a new, human made, mutated super disease. The reality is that scientists are most concerned about diseases that jump from animals to humans, as many such as Ebola have in the past:\n\n<blockquote>\"As the ecosystem and human habitats change there is always the risk of disease jumping from animals to humans. It's a natural process and it is vital that we are aware and prepare. It is probably the greatest risk.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nBeyond that, Dr. Group gets into a whole lot of pseudo-science about the pineal gland, and how the \"Globalists\" are trying to calcify it so humans can't use their third eye. He makes the claim that the only thing that can help with this is iodine, and what a coincidence, they sell \"the only real pure\" iodine on the market (Even if you believe any of this is based on science, all the new age websites say that turmeric is the way to heal the pineal gland, not iodine).\n\nEarlier in the day, police announced that their suspect in the Austin bombings had been killed in a stand-off with police. [http://definingmystance.blogspot.com/ Alex reports the existence of a blog] that is suspected to have been the bomber's, but at this point, I can find no evidence that the blog has been online since the time it purports to be (there is nothing in the Wayback Machine before March 2018, all of the comments are from March 21, 2018, etc). It could be real, and if it is, it is evidence that the bomber had conservative beliefs, but at the point of this writing, I do not deem it to be credible evidence.\n\nThe last troubling thing that happened on today's show was that Alex responded to an article about some of his comments about South Africa, and how it should have \"been like Wakanda\" if not for the influence of colonists. It is fair to say that Alex's comments were stupid, but also slightly taken out of context by the article. What is substantially larger of a problem is his response, in which he says this:\n\nFirst of all, the clip he's referring to is a clip of is of [http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/the-time-for-reconciliation-is-over-south-africa-votes-to-confiscate-whiteowned-without-compensation/news-story/a8a81155995b1adc1c399d3576c4c0bc South African Julius Malema], leader of the radical Marxist opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, and in the clip, he actually specifically says he was \"not calling for the slaughter of white people\u201a at least for now.\" Take the end of that sentence how you will, he specifically says he's not calling for killing of whites.\n\nMore importantly, this is an unbelievably telling sentence from Alex. The fact that he is saying that \"whites are being exterminated in Zimbabwe, Rhodesia, you name it\" tells me that he identifies with Rhodesia being a thing when in reality, it is the name of an internationally unrecognized state that hasn't existed since 1979.\n\nRhodesia is literally a symbol of the white supremacist, white nationalist movement. You may remember Dylann Roof wearing an apartheid South African and Rhodesian flag in pictures. It is not for no reason.\n\nRhodesia broke away from its existing status as a part of the United Kingdom in 1965 because the UK would not recognize their apartheid government, where the 3-4% white population controlled the entire apparatus of control. Wars with black liberation groups broke out, and the regime employed incredibly horrific means to stay in power, [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/31/archives/rhodesian-torture-is-called-routine.html including torture and rampant incarceration of black leaders]. In 1979, the government collapsed, but the racist myth of the white supremacist state of Rhodesia remains to this day. The fact that Alex Jones so casually throws in a reference to it in the context of his fake narratives about white genocide should tell anyone all they need to know, namely that Alex Jones has deeply ingrained white supremacist beliefs.\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/22/march-22-2018 March 22, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Kit Cope''': Kit runs Spike's Tactical, a gun maker/seller from Florida that was recently cracked down upon by YouTube. As this interview is happening, I checked and his YouTube channel is live, so I'm a little confused by their claims that it is not. Spike's Tactical is a sponsor of The Alex Jones Show, so this interview serves as a de facto commercial for them, as well as proof that Alex and everyone he associates with is under attack. Cope thinks that he is being singled out because [http://www.newsweek.com/not-today-antifa-gun-company-offers-zero-apologies-threatening-communist-783542 he dared to \"stand up to Antifa\"] when he made an ad that many saw as being very literally threatening to shoot people he arbitrarily was labeling \"Antifa.\" Also on this episode, Cope expresses that he believes that major shootings are false flags, using crisis actors.\n*'''Tim Harmsen''': Tim is the runner of the YouTube channel Military Arms Channel. He is on to talk about how his YouTube channel was taken down, but early in the interview he makes abundantly clear that his channel is currently live. His main concern seems to be that YouTube's rules are too vague, and that may be the case. In this instance, however, they have been very clear about the new rules, and he runs afoul of them because he runs a gun store and uses the channel as advertising. His argument seems to boil down to \"it's legal for me to talk about guns,\" but that is pretty irrelevant to the matter at hand. YouTube is not arresting him. Tim also believes the Southern Poverty Law Center is a radical \"far left organization.\"\n*'''Laura Loomer''': Laura is a completely insane \"investigative journalist,\" but more importantly an aggressive Islamophobe. She has actively advocated for banning Islam because she fervently believes that ''all'' Muslims are the same and she hates/fears them all. She used to work for Project Veritas and Rebel Media, which makes her unemployable at any real journalistic outlet, so she is \"independent,\" and shows up on Alex's show from time to time, generally to bash Muslims or to claim that various acts of white terrorism were false flags. Laura seems to be in favor of political censorship of art, as she was behind the publicity stunt disruption of the June 2017 performance of Julius Caesar where Caesar was a Trump facsimile, being willingly obtuse that Shakespeare In The Park has done iterations of the show with Caesar being Obama and George W Bush in the past. She is so terrible that even most of the Alt-Right doesn't like her.\n*'''Jon Rappoport''' hosted the 4th Hour, but Alex took up most of his time talking to Laura Loomer because he spent too much time talking to his gun buddies (sponsor) earlier in the show.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nOne of Alex's lead stories today is that YouTube is \"banning gun videos.\" This is a gross mischaracterization of the actual story.\n\n[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpxyw/youtube-bans-diy-and-commercially-focused-gun-videos YouTube announced that it would ban videos that directly sold guns], or linked to direct gun sales. Further, they would not allow videos that demonstrate how to build gun modifications like silencers or high-capacity magazines, or even show how to install such things. Whatever your feelings are about this (we feel it makes some sense, but may be impossible to enforce), this is not \"banning gun videos.\" People can still post videos of recreational shooting, or gun reviews, they just can't do so if they are sponsored by direct gun sales.\n\nIn an interesting turn of events, German YouTube creator J\u00f6rg Sprave has created a novel solution to this. He runs a video channel where he creates elaborate and cool slingshots, and in order to fight back against what he sees as encroachment from YouTube, [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pam5mk/youtube-union-slingshot-channel-jorg-sprave he has suggested that YouTube creators form a union]. Very interesting idea. Gonna guess Alex doesn't get behind that very reasonable and productive idea; he's probably just gonna yell a bunch and try to scare people into buying his pills, and his sponsor's guns.\n\nWhich brings me to the next important point: one of the reasons that Alex is particularly interested in misrepresenting YouTube's actons is that one of his sponsors is being affected.\n\nAlex runs ads for Spike's Tactical (he even airs one in the middle of his interview with Cope), a gun maker/seller based out of Florida, and [http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-gun-makers-banned-youtube-20180321-story.html they have had their YouTube channel cracked down on], because they sell guns directly (particularly AR-15s) and have videos demonstrating gun modifications ([http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-spikes-tactical-antifa-newsweek-20180110-story.html they also made an ad] recently where they kinda sorta threaten to shoot a bunch of \"antifa,\" which most thought was in incredibly poor taste).\n\nI understand standing up for your sponsor, but this is such a stretch. The way he is creating a complete strawman of the ban just so he can protect Spike's Tactical, seems to be letting the content of the show be led by the sponsor, which is pretty much Alex's style (see: years of warnings of imminent collapse of the dollar, while Alex's primary sponsor was a gold sales company).\n\nAlex's primary argument seems to be that, if conservatives get in trouble for not baking a cake for a gay couple, then YouTube can't in anyway police gun videos on their platform. This logic is profoundly flawed. For instance, people who like/sell guns are not a federally protected class, and the Civil Rights Act does not protect people who just like guns.\n\nIn the end, the only things they can come up with to resolve any of their perceived grievances  go 100% against Alex's principles. The fact that they are advocating for regulations on a private business (YouTube) and forming a union to protect their rights as \"employees\" (or \"creators\") just goes to show that, for Alex and his ilk, philosophies and belief go out the window when they feel threatened.\n\nAlso on this episode, Alex plays large segments of Donald Trump's speech announcing new tariffs on China because of their copyright infringement. This is very likely going to lead to a trade war that will hurt the American middle and lower classes very badly. Before Trump made his announcement, Chinese state newspaper [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-threatens-all-necessary-measures-if-trump-imposes-trade-tariffs-n858991 China Daily warned]:\n\n<blockquote>\"History has shown the pinpricks of protectionism can ultimately lead to the shots of war somewhere down the line.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nNot very subtle.\n\nThe timing for this is particularly bad, since Xi Jinping recently declared himself \"supreme leader for life,\" and as such cannot afford to show any weakness in the position, thus you can expect that he will respond harshly. Considering that China has a myriad of options at their disposal to hurt the US far more than these tariffs will hurt them (levying export taxes, increasing security inspections, delaying paperwork, messing with customs operations, etc.), and the fact that the US needs China's assistance to address the situation in North Korea peacefully, Trump's behavior is a very troubling development.\n\nMost likely, he is posturing to try to show strength in a negotiation that will end up leading us directly back to where we were before, with Trump \"virtue-signaling\" to his base that he is \"hard on China.\" Hopefully that's the case, because the other way this could go is a trade war in which the United States is woefully outgunned.\n\nLaura Loomer shows up toward the end of the show to talk about a new \"undercover sting\" she carried out at a meeting in preparation for the Parkland students who were going to the March For Our Lives. You can watch all of it if you have the patience for like five minutes of choppily edited audio, but based on my viewing of it, all she really captured on tape is a teacher admitting that they don't have a permit for a march, but instead for a rally, so after the rally, they may all leave the same direction. This happens at pretty much every rally ever.\n\nOn Alex's show, she makes some incredibly fucked up accusations that her video does not show. She says that the teacher, Debby Miller, tells the students in attendance that \"Jews run politicians.\" This is complete bullshit.\n\nDebby Miller is discussing how it is not going to be raining on Saturday, the day of the rally, at which point, she makes the following joke:\n\n<blockquote>\"I would say something about the politician who said the Jews were in control of weather, so come on.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nThe joke lacks a punchline, certainly, but she is clearly referencing the DC Council Member, Trayon White, [https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/19/17139516/dc-lawmaker-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theory-trayon-white who last week said]:\n\n<blockquote>\"It just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y'all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation. That's a model based off the Rothschilds, controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nCouncilman White quickly become a laughingstock on the internet, and he was roundly denounced by organizations Jewish and not-Jewish alike for his very clearly antisemitic statement.\n\nThis is what Debby Miller is making a joke about, and the joke is actually even funnier when you consider that Laura Loomer is going on Alex Jones' show to misrepresent Miller's words to paint her as an antisemite, when in reality she is making a joke about an idiot politician spouting antisemitic rhetoric, who was most likely influenced to believe that the Rothschilds control the weather from listening to Alex Jones. It is a propaganda ouroboros. Laura Loomer really, really sucks at this.\n\nThe only other thing Laura has to really \"reveal\" is that the Gifford Organization, a pro-gun regulation advocacy group run by Gabrielle Giffords, is involved in the organization of the rally. This is not surprising or scandalous for a number of reasons:\n\n**Giffords you may remember as the former US Representative who was shot in the head at a constituent meeting back in 2011. She survived, but six people were killed including federal District Court Chief Judge John Roll and a 9 year-old girl. The killer was Jared Lee Loughner, who left a trail of of very InfoWars-like rhetoric behind in [https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/01/08/Loughner-mused-if-he-was-a-terrorist/UPI-44681294537795/ blog posts], saying stuff like \"the government is brainwashing people by controlling language,\" something that Alex Jones says all the time.\n**Since that point, Giffords has been very active in pushing for gun control measures, for pretty understandable reasons.\n**It would be a little absurd to expect high school students to organize something like this without support from some relevant community organization. Alex's people seem to be so obsessed with demanding that everything be \"organic,\" not realizing that every rally they participate in has some Koch-related think tank or similar entity looming in the background and they can't even fall back on the \"I'm 17 years old and have no life experience\" excuse.\n\nAll in all, most of this show was Alex talking to gun guys about gun stuff, and how they're being oppressed. Very little of it was interesting, almost none of it reflected the real world. Other than that, it was just Alex killing time and Laura Loomer being a real big idiot.\n"

He has a long-history of advocating for indigenous peoples, going so far as to condemn the US Federal Government for their treatment of Native peoples. He has advocated for Hawaiian Independence since at least 1993. These are all very positive things, until it gets to the point where he argues that the Federal Government is operating out of a \"grotesque vision of a New World Order,\" which goes a long ways to explain why a guy who supports oppressed populations would appear on InfoWars.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nOn Thursday night, it was announced that Trump was replacing Gen. McMaster with John Bolton as his Homeland Security Adviser. This should be antithetical to literally everything that Alex stands for.\n\nAs an official in George W. Bush's state department, Bolton was instrumental in justifying the beginning of the Iraq War, pushing false intelligence to help make the case for regime change. His position was that there weren't enough countries on the \"Axis Of Evil,\" and that we should aim to take out even more leaders.\n\nSince then, Bolton has been very active pushing for a war with Iran, [https://theintercept.com/2018/03/23/heres-john-bolton-promising-regime-change-iran-end-2018/ going so far as to tell an Iranian exile group] (who is very unpopular in Iran) that there would be regime change in Iran by the end of 2018. He told them that eight months ago. He is the literal definition of a war-monger, and as Alex tries to pretend that he is against \"nation building\" and is for everyone having \"national sovereignty,\" Alex should be very, very against Bolton being anywhere near power.\n\nBut, because Alex is an idiot, he believes that John Bolton is just going to come in and be a strong force to push \"Trump's agenda.\" His only reason for believing this, of course, is that Roger Stone told him so. This should be an indication that Alex is past the point of no return; if he can accept the idea of John Bolton being in the administration, there is nothing that can shake him.\n\nTo give the appearance of \"looking at both sides,\" Alex has Dr. Francis Boyle on to say some negative stuff about Bolton. Alex doesn't engage about any of it, doubles-down on his position that Roger has fed him, and tries to steer the interview into being about something he and Boyle agree on, namely that Hillary Clinton sucks. It's a sad attempt at looking like he's covering the issues from all sides.\n\nDuring the broadcast, Trump holds a press conference where he discusses and signs the Omnibus Spending Bill. Before he signs the bill, Alex is absolutely convinced that he is going to veto it, to the point where Alex interrupts the video multiple times to say stuff like \"HE'S GONNA SHUT IT DOWN!\"\n\nAs soon as Trump signs the bill, Alex immediately starts equivocating, explaining that Trump has to keep the government going. It's a very sad turnaround to witness, especially after Alex plays the audio on the show of Trump explaining that an important consideration for signing the bill is to allow arms sales to Saudi Arabia to proceed. Again, that is arms sales to Saudi Arabia, something that Alex likes to pretend he's against.\n\nLater, Alex spends more of the show than he needs to to complain that Parkland survivor David Hogg is bullying him. It's your run-of-the-mill Alex self-victimization narrative, where he misinterprets complaints that people are making about him and just responds to the fake version as opposed to the real one.\n\nAlex takes particular issue with the fact that David Hogg made fun of Alex's \"gay frogs\" comments in a C-SPAN appearance, because Alex believes that science backs up his claims. Unfortunately, this is not the case.\n\nAlex keeps flashing up one article, a \"[http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/ Berkeley study],\" that he seems to think is enough to justify his claims that things in the water are turning frogs gay and that it will do the same to humans. The problem, as is so often the case, is that Alex did not do enough reading.\n\nWhat that article claims is that the chemical atrazine appears to be capable of inducing a change of sex in frogs that are exposed to elevated levels of it in their environment, but the issue with that is that some [https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/vbgvw4/a-quick-refresher-the-truth-about-water-making-you-gay fish and amphibians are able to spontaneously change sex], and the prevailing thought is that atrazine may trigger this mechanism, which does not exist in humans.\n\nThere is no implication for people, and studies that have shown affects on humans (such as aggravating cancers, for instance) have been redacted by the people who ran the studies over concerns that they did not properly carry the study out.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3230407/ Studies that have not been retracted] have shown \"there was no consistent evidence of an association between atrazine use and any cancer site.\" Or, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5072122/ others that have not been retracted] have concluded \"atrazine levels were not associated with ovarian cancer risk.\"\n\nThe way people are exposed to atrazine is almost exclusively as farmers who use it as an herbicide. Studies have shown an increase in premature births with farmers who use atrazine, but the results were deemed inconclusive because the farmers were exposed to many different chemicals, and the study could not pinpoint which might associated with the premature deliveries.\n\nThe only other ways that people get exposed are through some seepage into the ground water in communities very near farms that use atrazine, but studies have not shown this to be a very serious risk to human health.\n\nOne of the main reasons for why there are affects on frogs, but not on humans (beyond the very obvious and substantive biological differences), is that frogs live in water and breath water through gills. They are completely immersed in the water, and thus, if the water has a particular chemical in it, they are obviously going to be more affected by it.\n\nAll this is to say that David Hogg is absolutely right to mock Alex Jones for his stupidity, and Alex is such a soft boy for getting on his radio show to complain that a high schooler is \"bullying him.\"\n"

The event was a huge success, bringing out hundreds of thousands of people in DC, and tons more in cities around the country.\n\nNaturally, this is incredibly threatening to Alex, since he might as well be married to his gun and see every criticism of guns as an attack on their holy union. I think Alex's heart and soul wasn't 100% on Sunday, so to make sure there's enough testosterone in the studio, he has Owen Shroyer co-host with him, which leads to Alex forcing Owen into a bunch of weird high-fives.\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522075029784-1LBC95XNGA92W8GZTWVV/hifive1.jpg|thumb|none]]\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522075054362-TZR19ZQIKJYYNPBQ5WA0/hifive2.jpg|thumb|none]]\n\nThese two pictures were taken during two separate high-fives within about four minutes. It was a wild time.\n\nMost of the show, naturally, is designed to introduce all the necessary talking points that are needed to discredit the March For Our Lives. You hear almost all of the same narratives you saw with the Women's March (or any other gathering that Alex would rather not be allowed to happen, but he knows that argument is against the first amendment and would sort of reveal him as a fascist), but what is fascinating is how the same narratives are being fed by the same people.\n\nFor instance, back with the post-election rallies, Jack Posobiac was the source of \"information\" Alex reported about how there were buses parked nearby that brought people to the rally, which they extrapolated to necessarily mean that George Soros paid them all to be there. This time, it's once again Jack Posobiac who has provided that \"information\" for Alex:\n\nRemember, if you see buses anywhere, it is proof of Globalist trickery.\n\nBeyond all that, this episode is an absolute hodge-podge of terrible arguments that never really come together.\n\nAlex complains that David Hogg was reading off a script at the rally when he gave his speech. A rational person would reply, \"well, he's a 17 year old kid with very limited live public speaking experience who is now giving a speech to a crowd larger than any that most people will ever address.\"\n\nWithout providing any evidence, save for a few stray mentions of the Women's March, Alex asserts that George Soros is bankrolling this entire rally, in an attempt to take any validity away from the arguments that the people may be expressing.\n\nA couple of extremely fucked up things keep happening throughout the show.\n\nThe first is that Alex is continuing his terrible defense that he \"didn't say the kids at Parkland were crisis actors.\" Here is what he says about that on today's episode:\n\nAlex is walking this bizarre line that makes no sense, and he's doing so because he knows people are actually paying attention to him now. Whereas in the days of Sandy Hook, he could literally say that no kids died there, he can't get away with that level of bullshit now, so he has to restrict his efforts to mostly just \"muddying water.\"\n\nIf you listen to that clip, however, you'll see that what he is saying is that David Hogg, and presumably Emma Gonzalez (who he strangely isn't as obsessed with, though she is as front and center as Hogg is) were actors and had parents who are tied in with Alex's version of the \"Deep State.\" They were in the \"acting club\" and they have been \"chosen\" and are \"going off a script.\"\n\nHere's the thing: in order for Alex's version of events to play out, and for Hogg to really have been chosen and scripted by his FBI or CNN parent, they would have had to have been lying in waiting. The FBI and CNN would have to have children in every school that could possibly be the location of a mass shooting, so their child would be ready to be chosen in the event of a tragedy occurring, and they would have to have their children ready and \"scripted\" almost immediately, since David Hogg got interviewed pretty quickly after the shooting.\n\nThe only other way for Alex's timeline to work out is that the shooting was a planned event, which is what he hopes is the conclusion you will come to based on his \"just vague enough to not get sued\" words. It's complete bullshit, and represents a level of cowardice on Alex's part that is embarrassing. Just say what you mean, Alex. If it's true, you won't get sued.\n\nThe other thing that's really messed up is that Owen keeps trying to suggest that David Hogg is \"just going through a rebellious phase:\"\n\nI will keep this in mind as I watch twenty-something year old Owen Shroyer grow up and possibly realize the dangers of the rhetoric he's actively putting out into the world. I won't hold my breath.\n\nIn terms of fun stuff that happens on the show, we get a nice instance of Alex telling a clearly fake story about getting mobbed by a very ethnically diverse crowd of fans at Six Flags:\n\nThis is somewhat in service of a narrative that he's been pushing for a long time: that the youth, Generation Z, is mostly Libertarian Conservatives, and that the tide is turning. You see him telling these stories about being a rock star at his kids' soccer games and shit, and obviously it is him telling exaggerated stories that stroke his grandiose ego, but at one point on this show, he says that studies show that Gen Z is all like him:\n\nAlex says \"studies,\" but what he's actually talking about is one \"study\" carried out by a British marketing company called The Gild. Their results are the source that is universally cited in articles that discuss the coming generation's shift toward conservatism.\n\nThe problem is that The Gild's \"study\" is wildly unscientific. It is basically just a browser quiz with no procedural controls or methodology. It is the political orientation equivalent of a \"Which Member of NSYNC Are You?\" quiz you may have taken on Buzzfeed years ago.\n\nThis study should absolutely be discounted, as it doesn't meet the standards of what qualifies as a representative sampled study. For a more in-depth look at this study, [http://afterthemillennials.com/why-generation-z-is-not-more-conservative/ you can click here].\n\nAfter the first hour, Alex leaves Owen to host, so what's the point in listening to that?\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/26/march-26-2018 March 26, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Mike Cernovich''': Cernovich is a pile of garbage. Mike found his first crumbs of success as a member of the Pick Up Artist community. As a self-styled Fuck Guru, Mike gave dudes incredibly fucked up advice, like \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20160318163008/http://www.dangerandplay.com/2012/02/27/when-masturbation-leads-to-a-close/ when in doubt, whip it out].\" He made a very smooth transition into being a figure in Gamergate, as it seemed like a novel new way for him to attack women and pretend it's politics. After this, Mike made his way to Trump and the Alt-Right because he was concerned about \"[http://archive.is/JtEAY white genocide].\" After realizing that he was literally in bed with Nazis, he started pretending he wasn't \"alt-right,\" but was \"alt-light,\" as if there was a distinction. Much like Paul Joseph Watson, he's pretended to leave the Trump Train a few times, probably to cultivate the image of independence, only to come right back into the fold immediately. In Dec. 2017, Mike started trying to \"report\" on fraudulently created documents claiming to be sexual assault accusations against Chuck Schumer, indicating that he either was involved in the forgery or he was too bad a journalist to realize that they were terrible fakes and \"reported\" on them anyway. He is literally too much of a monster to describe here, so check here if you want more of [https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mike_Cernovich the Greatest Hits].\n*'''Gerald Celente''': \"Trends forecaster.\" Celente is, much like all of Alex's \"financial guests\" like Harry Dent or Peter Schiff, only on the show to spread pessimism and dread about the state of the economy. Though the numbers look good, don't trust them! He has a rich history of predicting market collapses on Alex's show, and then they never happen.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nIt seems like today is basically a repeat episode of The Alex Jones Show, as the first hour is almost entirely devoid of anything that doesn't feel like well-traveled roads.\n\nMany a complaint is made by Alex about how he is the real victim in the Parkland shooting. That probably sounds a bit extreme, but I don't doubt he really thinks that. If he truly believes that the \"democrat-Deep-State-Globalist\" cabal is using the shooting to take away the first and second amendments and are doing that by specifically attacking him, of course he thinks that's worse than, oh I don't know, being a kid who got murdered at their school.\n\nHis premise more or less relies on the idea that Soros is behind the March For Our Lives, which is a claim he makes repeatedly, but never really proves, beyond yelling about how there were a ton of buses in DC. Everyone knows that where there are a lot of buses parked, all of those buses must be paid for/chartered/rented by the same person. Buses are the dead-ringer of a Globalist trick.\n\nEven if some community or charity groups that were involved in the rally had received funding from Soros or The Open Society, that means literally nothing. In this very episode, Alex Jones calls himself \"the prophet of the Tea Party,\" [http://time.com/secret-origins-of-the-tea-party/ which was a movement completely bankrolled and created by billionaire Koch brothers]. So, using Alex's own logic about the March For Our Lives, what does that mean? It's utter bullshit; just because the Koch brothers created the Tea Party, that is not outright evidence that every member of the Tea Party does not believe the things they are advocating for.\n\nAlex tries to make the argument that at the March For Our Lives was not about sensible gun regulation, but actually about killing gun owners if they won't turn in their guns. He cites the fact that there were some people in the crowd with signs that indicated that the goal was taking away guns.\n\nTo use the same analogy from the Tea Party, we need not look far to find examples of people at Tea Party events holding signs referring to Obama as a monkey, using outright racial slurs, or even worse. Implying that one person's sign applies to the entirety of a protest is what's known as a composition fallacy, where you believe that characteristics one part of a group are indicative of the character of the whole. You would hope that people who try to encourage people to not have signs that are off-message, but the first amendment allows them to protest however they feel.\n\nBeyond this sort of stuff, most of the show is really just Alex (and Mike Cernovich) building up their credentials as victims and how their lives are in danger. Their complaints seem to come down to how people are paying attention to them and calling them out for their words, whereas they used to be able to hide in the dark corners of the internet.\n\nAlex makes an absurd claim about how mass shootings \"in red states\" always end in minutes because good guys with guns show up, but in blue states, they love to keep create situations where victims can be killed with impunity. This is categorically not based on any reality, and we did [https://knowledgefight.com/business/2018/3/26/alex-jones-does-not-understand-mass-shootings an in-depth look at the claim here].\n\nBeyond this nonsense, we learn from Mike Cernovich's appearance that he doesn't really have any principles and his behavior is mostly directed by whatever raises his book sales. This is demonstrated by him explaining that when he went on the \"mainstream media,\" it didn't move any books, but he sells a lot from InfoWars.\n\nOne might suggest that, the reason he didn't sell any books from being on the \"mainstream media\" is that when he was on, they very fairly made him look like the asshole lunatic he is. On the other hand, InfoWars is basically the QVC for unemployable, paranoid con-men; it would be a profound embarrassment if he wasn't able to sell books on InfoWars.\n\nThis is behavior that Cernovich has engaged in in the past too. When his MAGA Mindset book didn't sell as well as his older book, Gorilla Mindset, he took to his Periscope channel and announced that he was \"off the Trump train,\" and he even referenced the book sales as one of the main reasons for it.\n\nIt's a petty thing to point out that these people are all con-men, and their motivation to spread hate, confusion, and lies always goes back to money. Their allegiances are bought, and where the dollar is, there they will go.\n",

Incidentally, he's also terrible at political cartooning. It's not even that his conservative worldview is what makes the cartoons bad, it's more that he has a strange habit of labeling everything in his cartoons which is really the sign of a lack of craft. If the point you're trying to make isn't clear without labels on everything, it may be a sign that you need to work harder. Garrison appears on the show in a silly cowboy hat, which I did enjoy.\n*'''Jack Posobiec''': Posobiec is a Trump-hack \"journalist\" who also [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-jack-posobiecya-busted seriously pushed the idea that Pizzagate was a sex dungeon in the non-existent basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizza]. He was outed as being in \"military intelligence,\" but in reality what that meant was that he was doing piss tests on Marines. Jack has had his hands in far too many fraudulent media propaganda campaigns (Macron Leaks, the \"Rape Melania\" sign, etc) to detail all of them. Alex treats him as if he is some kind of expert on international relations, which is hilarious. Jack really sucks.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nOn this show, Alex unveils a video (made by Darren McBreen) which shows footage from the March For Our Lives, mostly footage of the kids who survived the Parkland shooting and aren't thrilled about having to have gone through that, and juxtaposes it with audio of Hitler:\n\nA lot of people got understandably mad about this, but as far as I can tell, this is just one of Alex's standard publicity stunts. He knows that if he does something like this, thousands of people will tweet about him, people will write articles about him, and he will get an absurd amount of free press. He's the P.T. Barnum of bigoted political speech.\n\nAlex's rhetoric is repulsive, and he should be ashamed of himself, but this is still an instance of him operating within the realm of free speech to a certain extent. Society would be much better off if they ignored him when he says stuff like this, and made a bigger deal of his overt white nationalism (last week, he said that \"whites are being exterminated in Rhodesia\").\n\nOnce Alex gets to the news, one of his main stories is about how former Supreme Court justice John Paul Stevens has come out against the 2nd amendment:\n\nAlex is referring to an opinion piece that Stevens wrote for The New York Times, and I am guessing that Alex just read the headline, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/john-paul-stevens-repeal-second-amendment.html Repeal The Second Amendment]\" and that was enough for him to know what it was all about.\n\nThe argument that Stevens is making is that until 2008, in District of Columbia vs. Heller, the second amendment was not legally understood to mean that individuals had the right to own guns. That was an issue left unsettled by the Supreme Court until then, and even in that decision, the judges came to a 5-4 decision.\n\nBefore then, the second amendment was more or less understood in its historical context, specifically that states had the right to keep militias to protect themselves from encroachment by other states or the federal government. It is a matter of great debate whether or not this was ever intended to guarantee the right of an individual to own a firearm.\n\nThe argument that Stevens lays out is that the National Rifle Association, a special interest group, is behind the muddying of the waters. Their deceitful efforts to apply the second amendment to fight against any regulations about gun ownership went so far that former Chief Justice Burger said that the NRA was perpetuating \"one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\"\n\nStevens suggests that the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to maintain a militia, is obsolete. Further, the second amendment, as a guarantee of the right to individual ownership of guns, is not a fully decided matter. As such, he says that gun-control advocates should just try to propose a new amendment that would undo the second amendment, which would in turn cripple the NRA's ability to block legislation that would protect citizens.\n\nI'm not sure if I totally agree with his argument, but I respect it as being offered in good faith by someone who knows the issues, and I do not think Alex read the article.\n\nThe truth is that there is no need to repeal an amendment, since even in DC vs. Heller, the decision provided by the Supreme Court very clearly pointed out that [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf the second amendment is compatible with gun-control regulations]:\n\n<blockquote>\"Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\n\u2014 DC vs. Heller, p. 2\n\nThe debate is not Pro-Gun People vs. Anti-Gun People; what we are living in is a coordinated campaign against rationality and decency being carried out by the NRA and the media/political figures that they have paid off.\n\nAround the second hour of the show, Alex has political cartoonist Ben Garrison on the show, and what ends up happening is a pretty hilarious scene. Alex's earpiece isn't working at the beginning of the interview, so he is unable to communicate with Garrison:\n\nIn order to deal with this, Alex just has Garrison vamp and ramble while he tries to fix his earpiece behind the scenes. Unfortunately, Alex forgot to turn off his mic, and some of his yelling was caught on air while Garrison was trying to make some stupid point about Karl Marx:\n\nThe rest of the interview is not really that interesting. It's just Alex telling Garrison that his work is perfect. It's so good, says Alex. Consider below, a sample of Garrison's work:\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522525012484-3R9RM72E1ZZ8CW0A1IHB/ben.jpg|thumb|none]]\n\nIf you zoom in, you'll see \"Gang\" as a label on the guy's head inside the saloon that has no ice.\n\nAlso, considering that Alex and Roger Stone are currently pushing the narrative that Jeff Sessions has dementia and needs to be taken out of office, I'm not sure even Alex would sign off on this one. Odds are Alex doesn't even like Garrison's work, he's probably just angling for a way to sell his comics on InfoWars' website and make a little cut of the money.\n\nOn this episode, Alex begins to predict that \"something big\" is coming, and that he feels a \"disturbance in the force that he hasn't felt since just before 9/11.\" This sounds pretty extreme, but it's that language is something he employs all the time. Just trying to get the audience good and scared, so they're in a state of mind to buy his products.\n",

[https://marias.org.uk/shazia-hobbs-forced-to-marry-and-violently-abused-under-sharia-in-the-uk/ When she was 18], she was made to have an arranged marriage that she did not want, which resulted in her suffering great abuse and beatings from her husband. After 3 years, she left her husband and was disowned by her former community. This is a tragic story, and we empathize with her greatly. We also philosophically agree with her that female genital mutilation must end. All that said, all of her credibility goes directly into the rubbish bin because she is [https://tommyrobinson.online/2018/03/meet-shazia-hobbs/ clearly working with Tommy Robinson], noted conman and xenophobic agitator.

All that said, genital mutilation is a problem, and there are a [http://16days.thepixelproject.net/16-organisations-charities-and-grassroots-groups-working-to-stop-fgm/ lot of non-Tommy Robinson related organizations] working hard to stop it.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nMost of the first hour of the show is dedicated to building up and screaming about anti-China narratives. Part of this is absolutely rooted in providing cover for Russia by saying, \"but what about China, they're the real bad guys!\"\n\nThis argument would hold more water if the things that Alex chose to criticize China about were more rooted in reality. Take, for example, this clip:\n\nAccording to Alex Jones, China has the \"keys to the kingdom,\" an analogue to something in the movie Elysium, because of course it's something from a movie. He's making the claim that China has control over all our telecommunications and that Google gave them that access recently.\n\nThe problem is that Alex is lying about what Google did. [http://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-icloud-china-iphone-data-privacy If you read the actual story], it's very clear that what Google did (which still isn't great) is that they moved the encryption keys for Chinese Google iCloud users to a local company in China, which all but guarantees that the government will have access to users' information. This has literally nothing to do with iCloud data for customers around the world; they are not encryption keys for anything except Chinese users.\n\nA legitimate criticism would be that Google should defend privacy, and maybe should choose to cease doing business in China, rather than give the government free reign to access users' data. An illegitimate one is what Alex is doing: creating a fake version of the story to scream about because it kind of fits in with his larger conspiracies about China and Google.\n\nAlex spends a lot of time on the show kind of obsessed about how cultures treat women. His contention is that the West is \"based on worshiping women:\"\n\nHis argument fails to account for the fact that women weren't allowed to vote for the first 144 years that America was a thing. It also fails to account for the fact that until 1922, women lost their citizenship if they married a foreigner, because it was just assumed that she had to be subservient to her husband (women still wouldn't be able to retain their citizenship if they married an Asian man until 1931). Alex seems to not know that [https://casetext.com/posts/reed-v-reed-some-background it was completely legal to just not allow women to practice law in the United States until 1971]. This is to say nothing about how until very recently, the idea of beating your wife was so common and uncontroversial that it was a frequent joke in popular culture.\n\nIf these are some of the manifestations of a culture that \"worships women,\" we need to examine what the hell worshiping means. We know damn well what he's talking about, and false worship is nothing more than a bullshit public face for suppression and cultural abuse.\n\nAlso, this sort of shit would sound a lot less like a rationalization for him to treat women like things (instead of as autonomous individuals), if he didn't say that a female caller was sexy, completely unprompted later on this very show:\n\nAlex has an interview on this episode with Shazia Hobbs, and most of it is just Alex trying to use it as an opportunity to attack London mayor Sadiq Khan as an \"Islamacist.\"\n\nWhat this came from is that in a video for the End The Hate campaign, Khan read a tweet of Hobbs's and editorialized that she was preaching hate. For context, the text of her tweet is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"If you use a knife to mutilate your daughter's vagina will the full force of the law be brought down on you? Asking for a Muslim. Thanks.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nI'm thinking, possibly, that the reason one might have a negative response to this tweet is the \"asking for a Muslim\" part. It kind of paints the picture that Muslims are the only people who engage in genital mutilation, which is patently absurd. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110570413000258 Christians throughout Africa engage in the practice], among plenty of other groups around the world. It's not an Islam issue, it is a men abusing women issue.\n\nThis highlights one of the very interesting hypocrisies of Alex Jones and his circle's approach to Islam. On the one hand, they argue that all Muslims are violent and dangerous because they believe that the Koran is violent, and Islam is a very orthodox religion. They make this argument to imply that whatever words are literally in the Koran, all Muslims must literally follow.\n\nBut then, as it relates to female genital mutilation, they will ignore that the prophet Mohammed said:\n\n<blockquote>\"Trim, but do not cut into it, for this is brighter for the face (of the girl) and more favorable with the husband\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nThey will ignore that Islamic scholars have interpreted the texts on the issue to be prohibiting of the behavior of genital mutilation, but permissive of circumcisions that do no harm to the recipient. Dr. Abd al-Rahm\u00e2n b. Hasan al-Nafisah [https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/442/female-circumcision-in-islam-part-2/ wrote an article on Islam and female circumcision] where he concluded:\n\n<blockquote>\"In Islamic Law, preservation of the person \u2013 the life and bodily soundness of the person \u2013 is a legal necessity. Anything that compromises this legal necessity by bringing harm to the person is unlawful\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nIt is much easier to scapegoat an entire community than it is to realize that all groups contain abusers, and figuring out who they are is a complicated process. In American culture, we've seen how abusers like Harvey Weinstein use their positions of influence as shields that protect them from the truth getting out. It's no different in other cultures, even if the positions of influence aren't \"fame,\" but instead \"community stature\" or something along those lines.\n\nAnyway, this is all to say that Alex is stupid.\n\nBut on this episode, he's not just stupid, he's incredibly scary. There is a real violent anger in Alex on this show, and it just keeps popping it's head up:\n\nThis sort of rhetoric is wildly dangerous, and is a sign of where Alex's head is at. It's a really sad glimpse into a man full of impotent rage, lashing out at an imaginary enemy while scapegoating real people who suffer real consequences, all the while sexualizing his female callers.\n\nThis was a pretty messed up episode.\n",

In his post-relevance career, he has become a huge voice in the gun loving community.

Climate Depot is a project funded and created by the think tank Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow, which believe it or not, [https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Committee_for_a_Constructive_Tomorrow received at least $500,000 in funding from ExxonMobil]. This is always the case for climate change deniers, you can always trace their funding back to oil companies or Koch-related foundations (which is also true in this case). Marc was also involved in the deceitful propaganda campaign against John Kerry known as the Swiftboating, where conservative liars spread lies about Kerry's military service in hopes of swaying the 2004 election. He has a career long track record of being a liar for hire, and thus, fits right in with Alex Jones.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThis show is all over the place, hitting on a lot of Alex's favorite talking points: Islam is evil at its core, guns are the greatest thing in the world, and liberals are \"the enemy.\" Overall, it's a pretty boring show.\n\nI will break down the things that merit mentioning in bullet form:\n\n*Alex airs a video of his 15 year old son Rex challenging David Hogg to a debate. It is one of the most disgraceful, embarrassing, and horrifying things I've ever seen in my life. The way Rex was talking bordered on an Alex Jones impression, and he was using many of Alex's catchphrases. It was very clear that either Alex coached him, or worse, he doesn't realize that he is emulating a horrible role-model. We still believe criticism of Rex himself is off-limits, as he is a child and he is being exploited, but I bring this up because of how poorly it reflects on Alex.\n*Alex spends a large chunk of this show screaming about how Muslims want to have sex with children, not realizing that two of his guests on ''this very day's show'', Tommy Robinson and Ted Nugent, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120530013851/http://www.loonwatch.com/2012/05/edl-leader-tommy-robinson-outed-as-child-sex-pest/ have sexually harassed underage girls on Twitter] or [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html adopted a 17 year old when he was 30 so he could have sex with her without her parents protesting] (and may have done way worse stuff too). Alex is a complete idiot.\n*Alex calls for the indictment of Robert Mueller, screaming vague accusations about him being \"on tarmacs.\" This is a reference to how Mueller delivered a sample of uranium that was confiscated from criminals to Russian authorities as part of a joint investigation. It was entirely above board, but Alex uses it because he is really scared about the stories that are coming out that notorious fraud-committer Ted Malloch may be in Mueller's cross hairs. And Alex should be concerned. Malloch was very involved in the Brexit campaign, and he was a behind-the-scenes adviser for the Trump campaign, the common thread between those things being Cambridge Analytica. If Mueller is speaking to Malloch, that is a pretty obvious sign that they have some information that his role in those two campaigns may have been connected.\n\nBeyond those main points that are pretty interesting, there are a few stray things Alex says here and there that seem very weird, but also seem kind of like him speaking extemporaneously. For instance, he says that he likes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. That seems strange, but since he doesn't really get into it, I'll wait until he elaborates to judge what he's talking about.\n\nAlso, Alex goes on a collaborative rant with Tommy Robinson about how the Russians did not try to kill Sergei Skripal and his daughter. The rest of the world is pretty much in consensus that they did, but I guess Alex has better information. He's usually right about everything.\n\nThe two of them scream about how \"they\" aren't even telling people if the ex-spy and his daughter are alive, which is weird because that is a [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/29/597937016/daughter-of-ex-russian-spy-improving-rapidly-u-k-health-officials-say very easy piece of information to find].\n\nMy favorite part of the rant is when Alex posits that if Russia was behind the attempted murder, they wouldn't have used a nerve agent, because smart assassins use \"a bag.\" Alright, Alex.\n\nDoug Hagman hosted the 4th Hour of the show, and I only watched a little bit of it because he's very boring, but thankfully I didn't turn it right off. In the beginning of their interview, Alex reveals that he definitely believes that the \"Globalists\" drink children's blood and that they need to scare them to produce adrenochrome.\n\nThis man loves to pretend he's just talking metaphorically when he calls people vampires, because he knows that when he makes the accusations literal, as he does here, it's really easy to see how most of his beliefs about the \"Globalists\" are just slight variations on generations old Blood Libel and other antisemitic propaganda.\n",

Whereas before, Alex had just been saying that he knew this because David Hogg was wearing an arm-band at the rally last weekend. Now, Alex is saying that Hogg was doing \"heel-clicks,\" which really seals the deal. It's a load of nonsense.\n\nAlex announces that he has just bought a Hitler outfit that is on the way to the studio, and he plans to make a \"satire\" video where he, as Hitler, endorses Hillary. It is always fun when we get to see a desperate publicity stunt being planned on air.\n\nAlex then elaborates on his past, particularly as it relates to abortions. In the past, he had admitted that he has paid for multiple abortions in the past. On today's episode, he clarifies that he has been involved in 10 abortions in his life. Far be it from me to judge, but it seems like a guy should probably learn their lesson and change their behaviors, say, somewhere around abortion #3.\n\nAfter he makes this admission, Alex fakes a phone call coming in that he needs to take, and has the staff air about 10 minutes of anti-abortion videos.\n\nThis is sort of a theme of this episode: Alex is not really into doing the job. He plays a ton of videos, he is killing time with standards \"blah, blah, blah, Soros is a Nazi, blah, blah, blah\" rants, and at one point he even has guest Katie Hopkins host the show for a segment, filled almost entirely with white genocide lies, while he does something else off air.\n\nOne of the things I find most interesting about Alex's interview with Katie Hopkins is not the content. It is par for the course to have Alex and his guests full-throatedly advocate for white nationalism. What is interesting to me is that Alex has recently been getting kind of horny on air when he's talking to women, and I'm not sure what this means:\n\nIt's not that this constitutes sexual harassment or anything, and Katie seems fine with Alex's comments, but this is absolutely unprofessional. It's even more bizarre considering that he is currently being sued by a former employee for sexual harassment. One would think he would not want to give off the perception that he is a little loose with sexualizing women in inappropriate contexts.\n\nBeyond that, this show is all just Alex vamping and killing time rambling about how he is under attack because he's right all the time and the Globalists fear that. Throw in a few rants about how the liberals want to rape and kill your family, and you've got a pretty good sense of how terrible and uninspired this episode was:\n\nI mean, Alex even said so much himself:\n",
      "Alex usually does not put stuff out on Saturdays, but today, Alex put out two special reports<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/3/31/march-31-2018 March 31, 2018]</ref>:\n\n1) '''David Hogg May Have Made A Joke On Reddit Last Year'''\n\nAlex recorded a 10 minute special report about how Paul Joseph Watson had found a \"confirmed\" Reddit account belonging to David Hogg, and that this account posted a joke about mosquitoes killing people in 2017. This, of course, proves that he is faking his outrage at his fellow students being murdered at school while he hid in a darkened classroom, not knowing if he would be killed as well.\n\nThe post in question is in response to a question about what good do mosquitoes do, to which this account replied \"They kill humans, billions of them, which is great for the environment.\"\n\nOn the scale of Gotcha Moments, this ranks as a zero. If this is even Hogg's account, this is a 16 year old making a joke on Reddit. Have you ever been to Reddit? This is an incredibly tame piece of business for that site.\n\nThe rest of the video is Alex lying about George Soros being a Nazi (he wasn't), about John Holdren's book Ecoscience advocating for culling the population (it doesn't), and speculating that the Rockefellers were going to spread HIV through mosquitoes ([https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/why_cant_mosquitos_transmit_hiv that is impossible]).\n\nIt was an embarrassing effort, and would have made the high water mark of Alex being an idiot for the day, but then he did this...\n\n2) '''Alex's 15 Year Old Son Does An Old School Wrestling Promo'''\n\nIt is our editorial position that Alex's son Rex is off-limits. He is a child, and there is literally no way that he understands what underlies his father's horrible beliefs. He was brought up with a paternal figure who screams Civil War revisionist history on the air, who repeats narratives from literal Nazi propaganda films in his documentaries, and who has very clear undiagnosed mental illnesses plaguing him.\n\nWhat we are getting at is that we do not blame Rex for this. But we cannot ignore it either.\n\nRex put out a video earlier in the week wherein he challenged David Hogg to a debate. In response to this, Alex's ex-wife Kelly contacted YouTube and insisted they remove the video, as she claimed it was a breach of an injunction in their custody agreement. It is impossible for us to know the specific details of their legal agreement, but it appears that YouTube did take down the first video.\n\nIn response to this, Alex doubled down, and Rex made another video later in the week. And then, on Saturday, they did this live video where he tries even harder to lure Hogg into a debate, and it is just tragic to watch.\n\nRex is doing an Alex impression through most of it. He's repeating propaganda narratives that he clearly picked up from his father. It is completely heartbreaking stuff to see.\n\nBut then, in a moment where Alex was hoping to prove that his 15 year-old son was speaking freely and there wasn't a teleprompter, the camera panned over and caught a glimpse of off-camera Alex:\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522558435730-CH6MK8BEGUBWVDVWKD28/0.jpg|thumb|none]]\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1522558411932-5TYOKOH1MD15CA1RK8ZO/000000.jpg|thumb|none]]\n\nIs that just a cup of water? Seems unlikely, considering Alex's penchant for drinking at the office, and his on-air behavior during these special reports. Here is a clip of him rambling and making no sense, and keep in mind, while he's saying this blather, his son is sitting right next to him:\n\nAll this is just terrible stuff. It's not even offensive in the normal way Alex is offensive; it's repellent on a visceral, human level.

      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/4/2/april-2-2018 April 2, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Gerald Celente''': \"Trends forecaster.\" Celente is, much like all of Alex's \"financial guests\" like Harry Dent or Peter Schiff, only on the show to spread pessimism and dread about the state of the economy. Though the numbers look good, don't trust them! He has a rich history of predicting market collapses on Alex's show, and then they never happen.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nToday's show is a real disaster. Alex spends most of the first hour of the show complaining about how radio waves and 5G wireless internet is intentionally being deployed to destroy people's DNA. This is a complete stretch, but it's too much to get into it here, plus there are more important issues to consider.\n\nThe most important thing on this show is that Alex has decided that he may have been too hasty in not calling David Hogg a \"crisis actor.\" For the weeks since the Parkland shooting, Alex has been saying that everyone is accusing him of saying that he called Hogg a crisis actor, but what he actually did was heavily insinuate that Hogg was a crisis actor. There is no difference between the two, but there is a valid legal difference.\n\nOn this show, Alex makes a jump in the wrong direction as he spends about half an hour of the show really drifting toward saying that Hogg is a crisis actor:\n\nThis is a very dangerous line of thinking. First off, Alex is trying to suggest that Hogg has been giving varying accounts of where he was during the shooting, and this is absolutely not true. Alex has an obligation to not report completely debunked things (especially about high schoolers who recently had their friends murdered at school), and he is derelict in his duty.\n\nThe confusion comes from Alex misrepresenting the quote from CBS where Hogg says that he got on his bike and rode three miles to the school to get interviews. Alex is pretending that he was saying he did that when the shooting was happening, but if you just take a second, [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17030294/florida-shooting-survivor-david-hogg-gun-control search for some context, and listen to the rest of what Hogg is saying], it is absolutely clear that he is saying he rode his bike to school '''''on the evening of the shooting'''''. He went back to school to try to cover the event and get interviews because he was interested in journalism.\n\nAlex is a complete idiot, and the implications of the things he's putting out are becoming really fucked up. If Alex believes that Hogg has been lying and giving different accounts about what happened on the day of the shooting, he must believe that Hogg is covering something up. And if he thinks that Hogg is covering something up, there is no doubt that Alex believes that he is covering up on someone else's behalf (obviously \"the Globalists\"). He cannot believe the things he's starting to preach without thinking that Hogg is a crisis actor, despite all his protestations that he hasn't literally used those exact words.\n\nLater in the show, Alex declares that Pope Francis is the devil, or possibly the False Prophet mentioned in Revelation. Alex is not 100% clear which character the Pope is playing, but he is super clear that we are now in the End Times.\n\nAlex has made this declaration because he saw a headline about the Pope saying that there is no hell, and that sinners are not punished in a fire pit after death. I have no idea why the concept of eternal punishment is so important to Alex (or any Christian, for that matter), but I guess it is. Probably some kind of feeling like, \"if they aren't punished for being bad, then me going to Heaven for being good doesn't mean anything.\" The human brain is wild.\n\nAnyway, the problem with Alex's rhetoric is that, according to the Vatican, [https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/did-pope-francis-really-say-there-is-no-hell.html this quote from Pope Francis is inaccurate]. It is a quote from an interview with a gentleman named Eugenio Scalfari, an 93 year old Italian journalist who \"prides himself on not taking notes or recording interviews.\" There is pretty good reason to believe that this quote is a little misrepresented, until Francis comes out and clarifies. But then again, that cool-headed position based on the facts does not make for very good screaming, so Alex goes the other way with it.\n\nAlso, Alex reveals that he believes that the \"Globalists\" are getting their marching orders from taking DMT and Ayahuasca and consulting with \"goat-people\" who are their spirit guides. This just sounds like a more creative version of your grandpa telling you that weed will make you gay:\n\nThe rest of the show is pretty boring and not worth discussing.\n"

      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/4/4/april-4-2018 April 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Mike Adams''': Mike Adams runs the website Natural News, which is your one-stop shop for all things that fall into the heading of \"medical bullshit.\" While the site is supposedly a place where you can get the information you need to try to argue with people about how bad vaccines are, it also seems to weirdly slip into political territory all the time, like [https://web.archive.org/web/20110430220951/http://www.naturalnews.com/032217_Obama_birth_certificate.html discussing how Obama's birth certificate is fake]. He has taken down all his articles about how most national tragedies are false flags, and now redirects them to a page that explains not that he was wrong and embarrassed about it, but that \"his mission changed,\" and it's all medicine now. Of course, that didn't stop Mike from creating a website entirely dedicated to harassing David Hogg, one of the survivors of the Parkland shooting, almost immediately after the shooting. It's called HoggWatch, and it's full of bullshit, with headlines like \"Dear David Hogg, you're a lying, opportunistic, insufferable little toe rag.\" Mike is a real top-tier asshole.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAlex completely loses it in the first hour of the show. It's probably a mix-up in his dosing of Super Male Vitality, but whatever the situation is, Alex is working himself up into a frenzy about false narratives about George Soros:\n\nThroughout most of his on-air breakdown, he is furious that the clip they have edited from the George Soros interview from 60 Minutes doesn't include the part where Soros says \"it was the best year of my life,\" so Alex threatens to play the entire interview. Of course, he doesn't ever do that, because in context, the audience would hear the part where Soros explains what he means when he says that the year of Nazi occupation was the best year of his life, which he is clear enough about in the clip, but [https://www.georgesoros.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/soros_on_soros-chap-2-2017_10_05.pdf he explains more precisely in his memoir]:\n\n<blockquote>\"That was my father's finest hour, because he knew how to act. He understood the situation; he realized that the normal rules did not apply... He made arrangements for the family to get false identity papers, and he found places for us to live or to hide. He helped not only his immediate family, but a fairly large number of other people around him. I can truthfully say that he saved dozens of lives.\n\nThe important and paradoxical point is that 1944 was the happiest year of my life. This is a strange, almost offensive thing to say because 1944 was the year of the Holocaust, but it is true. I was 14 years old. I had a father whom I adored, who was in command of the situation, who knew what to do and who helped others.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nGeorge Soros is very clear that that year was the happiest of his life because of how much he loved and admired his father's heroism. If Alex has done even the smallest amount of research, he has to know this, and he is willfully misleading his audience, which is evil.\n\nIn a hilarious way, Alex later addresses his on-air breakdown:\n\nIt's so pathetic how he has to really stress to people that his screaming fits are definitely real, although he is aware that they boost ratings. What an idiot.\n\nStrangely, Alex barely wants to talk about the shooting that happened at YouTube headquarters the previous day. It's tough to say exactly why, since all he really says about it is that YouTube kind of had it coming:\n\nThat's a pretty callous take on things. Also, YouTube didn't ban or censor the shooter, they demonitized her videos because her audience is not large enough. They are a private company, and they have the right to adjust how their platform operates. For a long time, no one was making any money for the videos they were putting on YouTube. Then, they added ads, and people could try to build up channels that drew in enough attention to make a living off of. Now, they are adjusting their model to only allow ads on larger channels that are appealing to advertisers. In no way is YouTube required to give people ad revenue if they don't have ads on their videos. Changing their business model is inconvenient for a lot of people, sure, and maybe it's unwise, but it doesn't mean they deserve to have someone shoot up their office.\n\nFor a large chunk of the show, Alex is joined by Mike Adams, who is a disaster. The two of them spend a little while complaining about already debunked conspiracies about David Hogg. Alex seems to be pushing particularly hard on the Reddit Post Controversy, and wonders out loud many times why no one is picking up the story. Our theory is because it's a zero, but Alex is sure it's evidence that Hogg has been a part of the Globalist/Exterminist Agenda for years.\n\nAfter they finish up tiptoeing closer and closer to the line of outright just saying the words \"crisis actor,\" and then Mike explains why Alex's audience is so smart:\n\nThis leads to a really long infomercial for their products, mixed with Alex and Mike jerking each other off about how each of their organizations are much bigger than CNN and MSNBC. It is a tremendous waste of airtime, but to be fair, Alex probably doesn't want to spend too much time talking about the news, seeing that [https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/04/politics/roger-stone-julian-assange-email-wikileaks/index.html things are looking pretty bad for Roger Stone] these days.\n\nOne other thing that is particularly interesting is that on this episode, Alex accuses the \"Globalists\" of being vampires, but he is quick to point out that he's not saying that they are literal blood-drinking vampires:\n\nThe reason this is interesting is that last week, on March 29th, Alex said kind of the opposite:\n\nReally, both arguments are stupid; one because it's so vague that it means nothing, and the other because he's saying that \"Globalists\" want to scare people so their blood is full of adrenaline which they can drink to get high. Both are stupid, but what is even more stupid is Alex trying to play it both ways.\n\nAt the end of the show, Alex and Mike joke around about cross-eyes. Being a cross-eyed man, I didn't get offended at their idiocy, but I was curious about what they were saying:\n\nAs it turns out, as is always the case when Alex says \"you can Google it,\" the search results do not back him up. As best as I can tell, he ''might'' be thinking of [http://readicon.com/maya-cross-eyed/ how the Mayans thought] that kids being cross-eyed was a blessing to the Sun God Kinich Ahau. If you search for \"aristocratic eye,\" you will find some well-priced monocles though, so I appreciate him helping me find that.\n"

      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2009/6/1/june-1-2009 June 1, 2009]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Jesse Ventura''': Jesse is a former professional wrestler, TV host, and Governor of Minnesota. All in all, Jesse seems like a pretty cool guy (outside of the weirdness surrounding his lawsuit with Chris Kyle; it's hard to tell what was going on with that). Whenever he's on Alex's show, he pushes back against Alex's rhetoric and tries to bring a touch of reason to the proceedings. It never really gets through to Alex, but we appreciate the effort nonetheless.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nMost of the show is taken up with Alex ranting about how General Motors had just declared bankruptcy, and how he had predicted that this would happen two years prior. His contention seems to be that this is the key, and that a dead giveaway that the Globalists are shutting down shop and destroying America.\n\nIt's worth noting that in 2007, when Alex would have been making these predictions, GM was in the middle of one of the largest labor strikes the company has ever experienced, as plants were shut down for over 20 days while the two sides tried to find an agreement. Given Alex's aversion to unions and collective bargaining, it can probably be assumed that this event is what led him to predict their eventual downfall.\n\nBeyond that detail, it was not hard to predict that GM was going to collapse. They had been posting losses in the billions of dollars for years before their bankruptcy in 2009, and they had sought government assistance, and both the Bush and Obama administrations did not agree to give them loans from the government.\n\nGM is not a tale of Globalist meddling, as much as it is the unfortunate story of a business that was overextended and losing money who got hit super hard by the financial crisis in 2008-09. They were already in bad shape, and when that blow came, they had to liquidate and sell off assets. They did so, and now GM exists as a smaller, restructured business that retained as much as it could from its past incarnation.\n\n-----\n\nAlex's callers are really interesting on this show. Most of them seem to want to plug something. One caller wants to plug a radio show he's starting. Another one, who goes by \"Bird Man\" wants to plug his punk band, as they do songs where they yell about the New World Order and would like to use some of Alex's rants in their music. Overall, you get a sense that Alex is not charmed by his audience at this point in 2009, he's more exasperated than anything.\n\n-----\n\nLooking back at this episode, there is one thread that seems to definitely run through all of Alex's career we can pinpoint, and that is a bizarre anti-abortion stance:\n\nI say that the stance is bizarre because in that clip, Alex is discussing a story of a guy who shot and killed a doctor who performs abortions, and he compares this guy to John Brown.\n\nAbortions are a medical procedure that are often needed to protect the health of a woman, and in the real world, if you do not allow women to have safe access to abortions, that will not stop abortions, it will only force them to have unsafe ones. The act of killing a doctor who performs abortions is not an act that will \"protect the unborn,\" it is an act of terrorism meant to restrict women's access to healthcare.\n\nIn the proper version of the metaphor Alex is trying to make, the man who killed the doctor is the historical equivalent of a white slaveowner in John Brown's time. They were people who benefited from an unequal social hierarchy and were willing to act abhorrently in order to try to maintain that status quo.\n\n-----\n\nOne thing that sticks out about this episode is Alex's ability to take criticism without getting mad. In this clip, he has a caller tell him that he is lying about being non-partisan and should just admit he's a right winger. While Alex doesn't actually address the caller's complaints, he also doesn't scream at him, which is absolutely what he would do now:\n\n-----\n\nFor a good 20 minutes of the show, Alex expounds on H.G. Wells and how his books are Globalist manifestos. In particular, he brings up one of his favorite Wells talking points:\n\nIf you have ever seen Alex's documentary Endgame, you will remember that the movie opens with the quote from Wells' 1936 book The New World Order:\n\n<blockquote>\"Countless people will hate the new world order and will die protesting against it.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nThe problem is that Alex is omitting a lot from that quote. If you go read [https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Wells_New_World_Order.pdf the actual book], you will see that the quote is actually:\n\n<blockquote>\"Countless people, from maharajas to millionaires and from pukkha sahibs to pretty ladies, will hate the new world order, be rendered unhappy by frustration of their passions and ambitions through its advent and will die protesting against it.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\n\u2014 Wells, p. 111\n\nWhat H.G. Wells is saying here, and what Alex has strategically cut out of the quote, is that when a more equitable system is created that serves humanity instead of business, that there will be kings and millionaires, rich men and high class ladies, who will not resist their unearned privilege being taken away from them, and they will fight against equality.\n\nThis is not a controversial statement; it's what we've seen time and time again. How many soldiers of the Confederate south died solely because the rich elites didn't want to give up slavery? This is a terrible song that humanity keeps on playing, and in fact, H.G. Wells' book was offering up a different path humanity could go down, a \"new way of ordering the world,\" if you will, and it's abundantly clear that no one listened to his words. The only person who knows about this book is Alex Jones, and he only knows one line of it, which he lies about.\n\n-----\n\nOne thing that's interesting to note is that, in 2009, Alex Jones thinks that Blackwater are a bunch of \"murdering thugs:\"\n\nThis is interesting, seeing how in 2018, Alex is very pro-Erik Prince, going so far as to say that he is a super-patriot. Goes to show just how far he's gone down the road of hypocrisy; even people he called a war criminal yesterday are super patriots today, just because they are involved with Donald Trump.\n\nThe last thing that is of note, perhaps, is that Alex lists the Rockefellers and the Hearsts as people he names as Globalists, but at this point, there is no mention of George Soros at all.\n\nProbably not too surprisingly, Alex ends the show by having a representative from Midas Resources come on air to list their current coin prices:\n\nThis is probably unethical, considering how he's doing a show built around convincing his audience that the GM bankruptcy is going to soon spread to all companies and paper money will be eliminated. But, we're not experts in business ethics.\n"

Alex is still going to support Trump, it seems:\n\nThere is an interesting trend going on where Alex appears to be getting close to abandoning the world, and encouraging his audience to head to the woods:\n\nThis is a natural development for any doomsday cult, and realistically, Alex has had all the elements for a long time:\n\n*Alex has an imaginary group of enemies that are oppressing him. Any misfortune that befalls him, generally the end result of some mistake he's made or some crime he's committed, gets to be blamed on these \"Globalists.\"\n*Alex has a designated savior in the person of Donald Trump. When his savior fails to vanquish his imaginary enemies, this will lead to a massive disillusionment, which is generally where cults go very bad.\n*Alex's early career is characterized by him being a David Koresh-apologist. While it is true that the government behaved a bit inappropriately in the case of Waco, it also cannot be disputed that Koresh was leading a violent and internally abusive cult. Alex never talks about that second part, only focusing on the first part, in an effort to exonerate Koresh.\n*A large part of Alex's paranoia and fear about the world relate to him either misunderstanding or intentionally misrepresenting technological progress. This is a technique that cult leaders often use to instill fear and loyalty from their followers.\n*Everything Alex says is about an \"Us Vs. Them\" mentality, where \"We\" are the good people and \"They\" are literal demons who can't speak anymore and are beyond saving. This sort of dichotomy really only serves to make a listener/follower feel desperate enough to make irrational decisions that serve this vague idea of \"Us\" (which always just boils down to giving Alex money).\n\nAnyway, this is an interesting trend to keep an eye on.\n\nAnother thing that is worth keeping an eye on is Alex seemingly encouraging Trump to take action on his \"enemies\" using the military:\n\nWhat Alex is describing is tyranny. What he is advocating for is exactly what it looks like when a dictator tries to consolidate power. This is a profoundly pathetic thing for Alex to be saying, especially two days after he got on air and said this same would-be dictator \"shoves ISIS up his dirty asshole,\" and that he is \"shit on [Alex's] shoe.\" I would be more upset, but \"profoundly pathetic\" is about par for the course with Alex these days.\n\nOne last thing to note is that Alex is continuing his trend of claiming that things his ex-wife Kelly tweets about him are being said by the \"mainstream media:\"\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1523995651313-5CD7PWGSXR9S1O2M3S2P/art.JPG|thumb|none]]\n\nLiterally no one in \"the media\" is reporting that Alex got his start with Art Bell. No one is even really tying them together, with the exception of his ex-wife, on Twitter. This tells me that he is absolutely stalking her on there and knows that it would make him sound too weak if he got mad about things she was saying, so he pretends \"the media\" is saying it.\n\nThis is the second time in a few weeks that he has very clearly done this, the last time being when Kelly tweeted about Alex getting a boost in his early career from Sinclair Broadcasting. While we do not take sides in personal matters, it is very important to note that Alex does seem to be exhibiting obsessive behaviors, while refusing to be real about what he is responding to on air. Again, \"not being real\" is pretty par for the course with Alex.\n"

      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2018/4/18/april-18-2018 April 18, 2018]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Sabo''': Sabo is a \"conservative street artist.\" I guess he's like a Banksy, but instead of making you think, he puts up Trump-centric propaganda around cities. Technically what he does is illegal, so Alex has to do a really stupid dance to keep himself legally protected, while also encouraging his audience to do more of what Sabo does. Sabo seems to think that \"conservatism\" (which by his definition is the Trump version of the alt-right) is \"the new punk.\" This metaphor might be reasonable, if in 1977 the Sex Pistols' music was all about glorifying the DuPont family.\n*'''Zaq''': Zaq (or Zach, it's unclear) is a caller who Alex insists is a high-level intelligence community operative. They've played out a very compelling radio drama together, where Zaq appeared on Alex's show, then was caught by the FBI who was mad that he was talking to Alex. Zaq was taken to a FBI base to be interrogated and have his phone searched. He was told not to talk to Alex anymore, at which point he called Alex and talked to him again. Then, he fled to Morocco. None of this is real, and Zaq as a character exists almost entirely because Alex is jealous of the internet having a fake source in the form of QAnon to obsess over, so he made one of his own.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAgain, we are stuck in a holding pattern of Alex Jones being super defensive on air about how he is being sued by just about everyone in the world. We have already [https://knowledgefight.com/business/2018/4/18/alex-jones-self-defense-about-sandy-hook-is-bullshit discussed in detail] how Alex is lying through his teeth about his positions on Sandy Hook, but that the relevant comments are likely past the statute of limitations, so he may be off the hook.\n\nOn this show, he repeats his standard lines creating fake timelines about his comments about Sandy Hook, and creating strawman versions of the accusations against him to respond to. It's very boring.\n\nGenerally speaking, Alex knows fully well where the line is between \"free speech\" and \"slander,\" and he walks right up to that line all the time. On this episode, he does an extended riff about how he thinks James Comey looks like a pedophile:\n\nThis is some hilariously weak stuff from Alex. Usually, he doesn't actually call out in the middle of his rants that he's aware that it would be illegal to say what he's implying, but that since it's just an implication, it's legal. Is this what he has been reduced to? Impotently lashing out at the appearance of his political enemies while reminding them that they can't sue him for it? What a mess.\n\nA little later, Alex has an interview with \"conservative street artist\" Sabo. Most of the interview is Alex trying to spitball ideas for an InfoWars art department (always trying to find new revenue streams) with Sabo and Ben Garrison being the main elements. We predict this will go just as well as Alex's 2015 idea about starting a \"Patriot Music\" record label.\n\nBecause he's talking to a street artist, Alex is hot and bothered about how street art is the key to destroying the \"Globalists.\" It's an interesting line that Alex has to walk because he knows that vandalism is illegal, so he can't outright tell his audience to go out and deface billboards, but he kind of does.\n\nThere are two very serious problems with Sabo's appearance on the show.\n\nThe first is that he seems to just be a Trump propagandist, working in a different medium. He doesn't seem to have any positive points, just standing for the belief that liberals are bad and he wants to attack them. He describes what he thinks is the difference between his team and liberals:\n\nSee, this is an interesting perspective. On the one hand, I kind of agree with him. Conservatives do just want to have BBQs and enjoy the inequitable system that is in place, languishing in a blissfully unaware state of all the (generally racist or sexist) injustices upon which their comfort is built. The liberals he is afraid of are politically active because they have reached a point where they realize that our society is in such need of sincere renovation that to not actively work toward that, to just sit idly by and \"have a BBQ,\" is ethically the same as supporting the underlying injustices.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think he meant it that way.\n\nThe other thing about Sabo's appearance that is a little troubling is that he kind of implies that he had advance notice of the propaganda campaign against Al Franken before it went live, and that '''''someone''''' enlisted him to put the billboard up on short notice:\n\nYou know who else mysteriously knew about the allegations before they came out? Noted political dirty trick man and [http://miami.cbslocal.com/2017/11/17/roger-stone-denies-involvement-al-franken-scandal/? InfoWars regular Roger Stone]. Probably a coincidence.\n\nLater in the show, Alex has Millie Weaver on to talk about how she went to a #MeToo speech in Akron, OH the night before and people were mean to her.\n\nThere is some true comedy in the sloppily thrown together video she made:\n\n**Millie is at a speech, and she asks the speaker, \"why are you excluding Bill Clinton's victims?\" to which the speaker responds, \"who says we're excluding anyone?\" Millie's question is not a question, it is an accusation, and the only thing she has to back up her accusation seems to be \"Juanita Broaderick wasn't in Time Magazine.\" That seems like a misdirected question. She should be talking to the editors of Time.\n**Millie's question that she asks the speaker boils down to \"are you concerned that the #MeToo movement is in danger of becoming partisan?\" The problem is that this question, in and of itself, is an attempt to politicize the issue. She prefaces the question by calling Bill Clinton a rapist and accusing the speaker of not caring about Juanita Broaderick, et al, which clearly demonstrates what her real intention with the question was. It is a bad faith question, and no matter the answer given, Millie intended to use the footage she captured to attack the speaker and the gathering.\n**Millie very clearly edits the footage to make it look like a march of protesters spontaneously appeared as soon as she walked out of the building, trying to give the impression that they were there specifically to assault her. Alex says as much, \"they were activated from a garage!\" It is very clear from context clues that this march took place after the speech, and Millie waited around and then cut it together to bolster the idea that protests/marches are not sincere expressions of speech and people's right to congregate.\n\nThis is a pathetic display of sloppy, poorly thought out propaganda. It reaches its logical conclusion when Alex ties in the fake \"Antifa/Soros contracts\" that his intern found on 4chan and Alex is pretending are real, and how they prove that Antifa is getting paid to wait in garages in case someone from InfoWars shows up somewhere, so they can flash-protest against them. It's absurd.\n\nAfter that nonsense, Alex's \"very real\" high-level intelligence source Zach stops by to drop some info. I can tell you in one sentence how I know that Zach isn't a real source: Alex says that he only has Zach for a very short time on the show today, yet Alex goes to commercial in the middle of the appearance and insists on blowing hard for minutes while Zach waits on hold.\n\nThe thrust of Zach's information seems to be intended to reinforce Alex's narrative that Nikki Haley is a big villain, and that she is trying to undermine Trump so she and Pence can run together in 2020:\n\nTo answer Alex's question if I have noticed that the media keeps saying that \"Pence can do no wrong?\" I have not. I definitely have not noticed that.\n\nMysteriously, Zach was very critical of Trump last Friday night when Alex was \"turning on Trump,\" but now that Alex has gone back and adjusted his stance, Zach seems to have adjusted his \"high end intelligence briefings\" right along with it to match exactly where Alex is. So weird.\n"

      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2009/1/7/january-7-2009 January 7, 2009]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Eric Plumley''': Plumley is a lawyer who has experience in litigating surveillance-related cases. Alex seems to intend to have him on to talk about the legality or illegality of the government monitoring people, but Plumley's specialty seems to be in cases of a spouse spying on their partner in order to dig up incriminating information about them. The interview is interesting, but it is clear that it is a much smaller focus than what Alex intended.\n*'''Ray McGovern''': McGovern was a CIA analyst from 1963 to 1990, and was involved in creating Presidential Daily Briefings, particularly in the Reagan White House. Since then, he's been an activist, voicing strong opinions against torture and the Iraq War. McGovern seems like a complicated figure. On the one hand, he has legitimate career credentials and has a track record against horrible things (like torture). On the other hand, he also has a history of going on Russian and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnEdZsq5N68 Turkish media] to support Russian talking points. He also [https://russia-insider.com/en/ray_mcgovern has written for Russia Insider since 2015], including such articles as \"How The West Provoked The New Cold War,\" and \"Swamp Psychopath (John) Brennan Running Scared.\" Not as damning as the writings of Paul Craig Roberts, but still showing a very specific bias.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAlex Jones spends a very large portion of this show complaining about a cop who recently shot and killed an unarmed man named Oscar Grant, in Oakland, CA. Grant may have gotten into a fight on a BART train at around 2 AM on New Years Day, 2009. Cops responded to the scene, where witnesses confirmed that Grant was \"peaceful\" when the officers arrived and that the officers were the aggressors. They ended up having Grant on his stomach on the ground, trying to handcuff him, when officer Johannes Mehserle shot him in the back, which led to his death hours later at a hospital.\n\nThis is a horrible story that we've seen play out so many times, but what sticks out in this case is that Alex Jones' take on the entire thing is 100% against the police. At this point in his career, he hadn't made the pivot toward pandering to military and police yet, so his perspective is entirely about how this is a horrifying example of police brutality. Most likely, he's just against the police because, at this point, he views them as extensions of President Obama, but whatever the case is, it is a tremendous difference from where he will end up being a few years later.\n\nThe rest of most of the show is spent with Alex talking about the Trans-Texas Corridor, the super highway that Alex is convinced is a Globalist takeover of the Americas, and will lead to the North American Union. None of these things came to pass, and the Trans-Texas Corridor did not end up getting built.\n\nHis topic on the TTC today is that \"they\" are saying that the plans for the road fell through, but in reality, \"they\" were just changing the name. This is inaccurate. The TTC never got made, and the North American Union remains a non-existent entity that really has no political traction and no one is really pushing for.\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2009/1/8/january-8-2009 January 8, 2009]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Steve Quayle''': Steve Quayle is an unhinged lunatic, and someone who Alex Jones looks to as a very seriously credible source. [http://www.stevequayle.com/index.php?s=26 He has written books] about how there used to be literal giants walking the Earth, how the Nazis didn't lose WWII and actually have a base under Antarctica, how most natural disasters are really weather weapons, among many other insane topics. Alex made clear on another episode that Steve is the source for most of his \"chimera narratives,\" which is really sad.\n*'''Paul Craig Roberts''': Roberts was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under President Reagan in 1981, and after that became an editor for the Wall Street Journal and a Distinguished Fellow at the Cato Institute. Since at least 2014, he's been a columnist for [https://russia-insider.com/en/paul_craig_roberts Russian Insider] and [https://sputniknews.com/authors/paul_craig_roberts/ Russian state-owned outlet Sputnik], writing articles with titles like \"America Has No Unifying Moral Culture-It Will Lose A War Against Russia,\" \"Will Putin Realize That Russia Holds All The Cards?\" and \"Privatization Is The Atlanticist Strategy To Attack Russia.\"\n*'''David Icke''': Where to begin? David Icke was a sports broadcaster in the UK, until he went on Terry Wogan's talk show in 1991 and declared that he is the son of God. From there, he went on to be laughed at for a while, but he came out the other side of it with a pretty respectable career giving lectures about the \"Reptilian bloodlines\" that control the world and have for generations. He believes the Protocols of Zion are real (they are not), and he has signed off on almost every conspiracy theory out there. Also, since this appearance, [https://www.davidicke.com/article/450268/clueless-alex-jones-true-history-israel-really-happening-middle-east-european-migrant-crisis he's had a falling out with Alex Jones] and believes him to be a disinformation agent.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nAlex Jones makes a very damning statement on today's show that reveals that his affinity for Russia dates back even to 2009.\n\nOn January 7, 2009 (the day prior to this episode), Russia cut off the oil that was transported through Ukraine, en route to many other countries in Europe, leaving 17 countries almost entirely without the oil that they needed to heat homes in the dead of winter. This was the end result of a breakdown in a financial deal between the two countries, and as it relates to how things ended up getting to the seriously dangerous point they reached, both Russia and Ukraine have blame to share.\n\nHowever, one thing that no one in their right mind would have said in the immediate aftermath, or years later even, is what Alex Jones says on his show:\n\nAlex does not only say that it is Ukraine's fault that oil shipments were shut down; he says that Ukraine shut off the oil. He is implying that Russia did not even have a part in the situation, that shutting down oil deliveries was not literally and entirely a decision that Russia made.\n\nYou can read [https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NG27-TheRussoUkrainianGasDisputeofJanuary2009AComprehensiveAssessment-JonathanSternSimonPiraniKatjaYafimava-2009.pdf an in-depth assessment of the 2009 oil dispute] from the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, and you can get a sense of the underlying negligence and sloppy communication that led Europe to this brink, but what you cannot in any way justify is the idea that Ukraine shut off the oil. That is a narrative that, quite literally, only someone who willingly disseminates Russian propaganda, or someone who naively believes said propaganda and repeats it as fact, could possibly think. Suffice it to say that Alex Jones had been loving and covering for Russia long before Donald Trump came into the picture.\n\nTo drive that point home, here is a clip of Alex announcing his upcoming appearance on RT, while we watches and yells over a little snippet of Red Dawn:\n\nIn case you were wondering, the appearance he's plugging is on the day of Barack Obama's presidential inauguration. Spoiler alert: On January 20th, Alex Jones leaves his own show for half an hour to do an interview on RT about how bad Obama is. His priorities should be pretty clear from that: on what should be one of the biggest days of his own career, Alex leaves his own post to appear on a hostile foreign power's state-owned media network. All about a week and a half after he said that Ukraine shut off the oil to Europe, and then moved on, never covering the story again. This does not seem coincidental.\n\nAnyway, most of the rest of the show involves Alex further covering the San Francisco police shooting he covered on yesterday's show. He has now decided that the cop is a lunatic, and he's gotta go to jail for his actions, something he would never, ever say a few years after this episode.\n\nThe other most notable thing about this episode is the fundraising aspects of the show. He does one thing that is hilarious, and one thing that borders on illegal (but he does all the time), while trying to raise funds on this episode.\n\nThe hilarious thing is that he is trying to sell a broken bullhorn that he used to yell into, and he's reporting some very serious bids coming in on it.\n\nAlex spends a shockingly high amount of time on this episode being very defensive about the idea that he's selling a broken bullhorn, as if his audience would not understand the idea of \"memorabilia\" having value outside of functional use. If I recall correctly, he's getting bids in the range of $50,000 toward the end of this episode, or at least he thinks he is.\n\nThe other fund-raising initiative that is in play today is that Alex finishes up the show with a visit from Ted Anderson, owner of the Genesis Communications Network (GCN) and owner of gold/silver sales firm Midas Resources. Ted started GCN to use as a promotional wing for Midas Resources, so it's always been about selling gold for him, but looking back at 2009, it's pretty mind-blowing to see how deeply involved Alex was in trying to push business to Midas.\n\nAlmost every day, he finishes up the show with a visit from Ted, if he doesn't talk to him in the middle of the show, often coincidentally right after he concludes an interview with one of his guests who likes to predict imminent financial collapse (see: Gerald Celente, Bob Chapman, Paul Craig Roberts, Peter Schiff, almost anyone who comes on Alex's show honestly).\n\nIt's almost like Alex understands that it is his job to get his listeners into a suggestible state by scaring them with interviews with lunatics masquerading as experts telling them that soon their dollars will be worthless, at which point he brings in Ted with the solution to all those problems: gold!\n\nI would say that these guys are the bigoted and paranoid version of the Home Shopping Network, if the con-men on the Home Shopping Network had designs to reshape society into a white-supremacist Christian chauvinist feudal state.\n",
      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2009/1/9/january-9-2009 January 9, 2009]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Russell Means''': Russell Means is an interesting guest for InfoWars. On the one hand, he has a decades long history of activism, engaging in occupations and protests against the mistreatment of Native Peoples in America. On the other hand, he is probably also a crazy person. For instance, he was ready to sign up as Vice President to campaign with Larry Flynt in 1983. For another, he was arrested for assault and battery of his 80 year-old father (who had one false arm), and [https://www.aimovement.org/moipr/onrussellmeans.html in 1999 the American Indian Movement (AIM) put out a press release repudiating him] and saying that, though he may represent himself as involved with AIM, he was not. As is so often the case on this show, it appears we are dealing with a con-man.\n*'''Bob Chapman''': Bob Chapman is an absolute mystery, and all I can tell you for certain about him is that there is something very sinister afoot in his life. For one thing, [http://theinternationalforecaster.com/page/bob_chapman he claims that he was \"probably the largest gold and silver stockbroker in the world\" from 1970-1988], a claim that if true would have to make Bob at very least a multi-billionaire, which raises the question of why he would appear on InfoWars to shill gold at age 73 if he was a billionaire. It doesn't add up. But then, you peel back the next layer, and you learn that until 1976 he focused his gold business almost entirely on South African (apartheid era South African) gold, in fact he spent the years 1970-1973 living in apartheid era South Africa and the short-lived literal white nationalist state Rhodesia. He helped Gary Allen finance the printing of his book None Dare Call It Conspiracy (the book that \"woke Alex Jones up\") with money he was making from stealing South African resources and while he was living in apartheid countries in Africa. Also, one time, [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-january-7-2011 he claimed he saw a video of Ronald Reagan getting butt-fucked].\n*'''Alan Watt''': Alan Watt is not Alan Watts. Those are different guys, don't get them confused. Alan Watt is an idiot who mostly rambles about the NWO and Illuminati, spinning yarns about vague theories of their nefarious doings throughout history. It's all bullshit, and he's real boring.\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThere are a couple of very, very important things that come up on today's show, but before getting to them, Alex does give an update about how he is selling his broken bullhorn, lovingly nicknamed TyrannyCrusher One:\n\nIt turns out that Alex's eBay auction for his broken bullhorn fell prey to some troll bidding, and now he may not be able to sell it after all, what with the time it will take to go through the bids and see if any of them are real.\n\nThat seems like a job for eBay, and really shouldn't represent any time commitment on Alex's part, but whatever. The part I'm far more interested in is the part where Alex is convinced that anything negative that happens to him must be the government coming after him. The reality is that people on the internet like to fuck around and 2009 was basically the wild west for this sort of thing.\n\nWhat Alex is doing is really smart though, painting a run of the mill internet prank as targeted harassment from government shills does make it appear that his work is far more dangerous and based in reality than it actually is. Propaganda truly is about the management of appearances, so it's important for even minor things like this to be presented as sinister attacks against \"the republic,\" or some shit.\n\nIt is really stupid, but it does lead to this incredibly stupid attack on Alex's critics:\n\nRegardless, on to the more important things on this episode. These are very important, so I will need to deal with them as bullet points:\n\n1) '''Alex Jones Criticizes Israel For Shooting Palestinians'''\n\nThis is pretty huge, and is diametrically opposed to Alex's position in 2018. When Israeli snipers shot and killed over 50 Palestinians in May of 2018, most of them completely unarmed and peacefully demonstrating, Alex's response was to affirm his support of Israel, and to play rhetorical \"what about this?\" type games about how bad he thinks Muslims are, lying about \"hourly suicide bombings\" that the media doesn't report:\n\nWe can see here a major pivot in his position. This is something that demands an explanation, and I do not trust the one that Alex would offer up, namely that he \"didn't realize how evil Islam was in 2009.\" Alex's rhetoric about the \"Globalists\" wanting to flood \"Western\" (he means \"white\") countries with immigrants in order to destroy their economies, is alive and well in 2009. This is one of the things he claims is his biggest issues with Islam, and it's a complaint he is making in 2009, so I reject that as what has changed for him.\n\nIt is hard to say without having all the evidence at our disposal, but this is going to be something that we watch very closely as 2009 progresses. As it stands, this is one of the most glaring examples of something that needs explaining that we've found in the past so far.\n\n[Note: we in no way believe that this is an indication that Alex works for Israel or Mossad. The people who put forth those sorts of theories generally seem to hold to a particular belief system that we do not think is a coincidence. I don't rule out any possibility, but all \"evidence\" I've seen has been very weak, and there are many other possible explanations for why Alex changed his position on Israel]\n\n2) '''Alex Is In Very Deep As A Gold Con-Man'''\n\nFor a long time, it's been perfectly clear that Alex is running a gold-sales scam at the behest of Ted Anderson, owner of the Genesis Communications Network and the gold/silver outlet Midas Resources.\n\nHow I imagined it, Alex is kind of crazy and paranoid to begin with, but he's in enough control of it to be able to use it to sell things. He probably does believe that the \"Globalists\" are putting things in the water, but he also knows that if he yells about it more and exaggerates the danger, he will sell more units for his water filtration sponsors. He probably is a Doomsday Prepper-type at heart, but if he amps up how passionate he seems about fearing that the end is coming, that translates to more sales for his survival food sponsor. I made the fairly generous assumption that the relationship between Alex's content and his sponsors was incidental or possibly benign.\n\nAfter experiencing a bit of 2009 episodes, I no longer think InfoWars is a case of benign or incidental sales. I am becoming more and more convinced that we are not looking at a radio show where the host has positions, and conveniently he has sponsors related to the things he talks about. I am becoming concerned that the advertisements on InfoWars dictate the content.\n\nOn this episode, Alex Jones welcomes Bob Chapman to the show, and they very predictably have a conversation about how the economy and the dollar are about to collapse. They spread a ton of real over the top financial fear, before Bob reaches the natural conclusion of their conversation, telling the audience that the only safe option in the world is gold:\n\nAt this point, Bob Chapman straight up just tells Alex's audience that what they need to do is call Midas Resources. Keep in mind that Bob Chapman is appearing on the show, ostensibly, as a financial expert, not as a booster for Midas Resources, which again, is the company that owns GCN, the company that syndicates Alex's show (and is responsible for most of his ad revenue).\n\nLeave aside for a second that Bob Chapman buys ads on GCN programming to promote his newsletter, The International Forecaster. Forget that Midas Resources offers a free issue of The International Forecaster along with gold/silver purchases. Actually, scratch that, there is no way to ignore these absurdly intertwined, overlapping, and undisclosed business relationships between these guys. This is absolutely the definition of immoral advertising.\n\nThis kind of thing should be a huge red flag for anyone listening, and it should be completely clear what is going on as soon as Alex gets Ted Anderson himself on the line to chat with Bob Chapman about how important it is to buy gold and how good the Midas deals are if you want to buy gold NOW!\n\nThese men are running a very basic con where Alex has someone on as an expert who is actually a shill for Midas Resources. The two of them get the audience ready to hear a gold salespitch, usually by peddling fear based on misrepresentations of news stories or history, and when the audience is good and primed, they bring in the closer, Ted Anderson to give you the deals, deals that you would be so stupid to pass up.\n\nIt doesn't get ore see-through than this as a con, and if they would be willing to stoop to this level, it really has to call into question all the rest of InfoWars operation. Very likely, the entire thing is probably not above board.\n"

      "This portion was reproduced from the official Knowledge Fight website.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2009/1/21/january-21-2009 January 21, 2009]</ref>\n\n===Guests===\n\n*'''Marty Shackter''': Marty is the owner of one of Alex's primary sponsors, Cal-Ben Soaps. Once a month or so, as part of his sponsorship contract, Alex has to let Marty come on the show and talk about how no other soap is really soap. Then, every time he's on, in order to make his ad revenue, Alex Jones has to set up Marty to tell a dirty limerick on air that has nothing to do with anything, and often is not even technically a limerick. I love this so much, as it demonstrates clearly how desperate Alex was for money in 2009. He was [https://knowledgefight.com/business/2018/4/11/alex-jones-used-to-accept-ad-money-from-a-cult accepting ad money from a cult], and he let an old man tell dirty poems on air. Here is the \"limerick\" from this episode:\n*'''Barry Cooper''': Barry Cooper is a retired police officer. He alleges that he used to plant drugs on people to set them up for convictions, but after getting high and exploring hallucinogens, he realized that there was a better way in life. It's a good story, but I don't believe any of it, except that he probably was a cop. Barry has for many years hosted [https://nevergetbusted.com/how-to-pass-a-drug-test/ a website where he gives people advice about how to cheat a drug test], which (assuming his advice is accurate) is pretty cool. Since his 2009 appearance on Alex's show, he's begun offering [https://triptowellness.net/ Ibogaine and Ayahuasca \"retreats\" in Mexico], with promises of a quick fix for addiction (not to mention all the mental illnesses that magically get cured). The science is pretty unclear currently, but it looks like these intervention methods are really only effective for cessation, [https://americanaddictioncenters.org/meth-treatment/success-rate-for-ibogaine/ not for keeping people sober]. Patients who do not enter therapy or join a recovery group after the Ibogaine interrupts their process of addiction show relapse rates as high as 90%, according to some experts. These retreats are possibly helpful to start a life-long process of recovery, but Barry is not selling them that way, which leads me to believe he's a con-man, fleecing vulnerable addicts who are desperate for a way out. The fact that prices \"start\" at just under $5,000 for the retreat, and [https://triptowellness.net/itinerary-and-what-to-expect/ that price doesn't include travel, hotel, or food] doesn't help. Bottom line, this is not a man I want to trust with my vulnerable mental health issues. I feel that point is well illustrated by this clip from his appearance, where he explains that he would replace sex ed in schools with a class that teaches girls to be \"less jealous,\" which turns out to just be a way for Barry to vent about his ex-wife:\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThis episode is a Tale Of Two Cities. On the one side, you have the two completely insane guest appearances mentioned above, and on the other, you have Alex spending about 80 minutes \"deconstructing\" Obama's inauguration speech from the day prior. He could have \"deconstructed\" it yesterday, but if you'll recall, he was too busy leaving his own show to be interviewed on Russia Today.\n\nThere are a few other notable moments to discuss that don't fall into one of those baskets, the most interesting being Alex again insisting that \"Congress is under martial law,\" but on this episode, he expands on that a little more:\n\n[https://knowledgefight.com/the-past/2009/1/20/january-20-2009 In the breakdown of yesterday's episode], I explained the manipulation Alex is using about the varying definitions of \"martial law,\" and how that doesn't mean what he is pretending it means when the term is used in relation to Congress. It just means that they are moving to waive the three day waiting period that's usually required between proposing a bill and voting on it. It has nothing to do with the \"InfoWars definition\" of martial law, which is less about impatience and more about a police state.\n\nTo support his narrative about Congress, Alex brings in the \"[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg555.pdf War Powers Act],\" which is profoundly weird. It's so completely unrelated to the things he's talking about that I sincerely am starting to question whether or not he is just speaking completely randomly, like some kind of paranoid, militia themed MadLibs (possible name for such a product: Super Mad At Libs).\n\nThe War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973, and was largely a response to the shit-show that was the Vietnam War. 58,000+ Americans were killed and over 300,000 wounded, 200,000-400,000 South Vietnamese dead, in a war that was ultimately pointless. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States War was never declared in Vietnam, nor in Korea], nor later in the Persian Gulf; these were just called \"military actions,\" or some other euphemism to get around the fact that according to the Constitution, the President can't just declare a war, but instead has to go to Congress, which has the ultimate authority to go to war.\n\nThe War Powers Resolution was an attempt to make sure something like the Vietnam War never happened again, and that cooler heads would prevail to keep the US from engaging in wars they have no business in. It was a failed attempt, but that is clearly the spirit of the Resolution, as it seeks to lay out a time-table wherein the President's power to introduce US troops into hostilities would be checked by having to report to Congress within 48 hours, and then repeatedly afterwards to justify the continued troop presence.\n\nThis system has been abused by many Presidents and many Congresses, but on it's face, this Resolution was an attempt to solve a very serious problem. It failed, but that should be considered a corruption and human failing, not a sign that the Resolution is meant to make more war.\n\nThe bigger point, though is that the War Powers Resolution literally has nothing to do with the \"martial law rule\" in the House, nor does it have anything to do with the federal bailout of the banks that is the root of the Congressional martial law narrative that Alex is talking about in the first place.\n\nIt's very clear what Alex is trying to make his audience think here, which is where I have to abandon my \"he's just saying random words\" theory. Here is a little construction of how he wants his audience to understand what he's saying:\n\n**They are desperate to pass this bank bailout bill, because it is how they will fund the New World Order, and will allow them to be able to afford to oppress everyone\n**They can't get the bailout bill through Congress unless they use force to do it, so they have put Congress under martial law\n**\"Martial law\" is a state of emergency, which is listed in the War Powers Act as a reason for the President to be able to call in the military as his jack-booted thugs: \"The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to... a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.\"\n**Therefore, in order to force through their bank bailout bill, the \"Globalists\" are positioning a situation where Obama can call in the military to kill all the patriots (or just fill in the blank conclusion with whatever paranoid fantasy scenario you like best).\n\nThis may not be exactly what he's going for, but I assure you, it is something close to this, and it's all bullshit. He's misreading every primary source, he's lying about what \"Congressional martial law\" means, and he's making insane logical leaps that are completely unsupported by fact or solid inference. I apologize that this has gotten so long already, but it is crucially important to understand that this is the level of thinking that is behind almost all of the things that Alex Jones says. Generally speaking, nothing he says means anything.\n\nSpeaking of saying things and meaning nothing, the entirety of Alex's \"deconstruction\" of Obama's inauguration speech is completely skippable. It is a classically Alex Jonesian performance, where he does the same thing he does every time he is forced to analyze something where he can't just lie about the primary source: he just hinges on single words or phrases and launches into petty, vague critiques about them, so as to chop up the speech into such a disjointed thing that no little piece can be taken in the context Obama meant it in. Here is but one example of that technique:\n\nHere, Alex just hears Obama mention a \"new age,\" so he cuts off the clip and goes off about it being \"New World Order Talk:\"\n\nFor the side that acts like they're all about free speech and can't stand \"language policing,\" the Alex Joneses of the world sure are triggered by a lot of innocuous terms.\n\nIn this clip, you can see Alex taking Obama being a generally gracious human and thanking Bush for his service into somehow being proof that...the collapse is coming?\n\nOne has to wonder what Alex would have preferred Obama do in that situation. Should he have just ignored that the former President was there? Should he have spit on the Bush family? There is no action that Obama could have taken in this situation that Alex would have not turned into some indication that he's been right all along, Obama is an evil front-man, and the shit is about to hit the fan.\n\nThis is kind of all that this half of the episode is. It's completely surface-level engagement with Obama's actual speech, mixed with insanely desperate attempts to combine words and phrases Obama used with some other scary idea that Alex likes to talk about. There's not much else to say about it.\n\nOh, except that it gets a little racist:\n\nFirst point, Alex again brings up the \"Globalist overlords\" and mentions people like the Rockefellers, but never mentions George Soros. It's almost as if he hasn't been told to demonize Soros yet. Weird.\n\nSecond, how dare Alex be mad that Barack Obama would give a recognition that black people have had a horrible time historically in our country? Also, how is it not a unifying idea to recognize and empathize, on a deeply human level, that this country was built on deeply racist foundations? It is no slight against any white person to recognize that the entire system was created intentionally in such a way as to exclude non-whites and women from being able to have any capital power, and thus any real control over their lives. Recognizing the common stain that is on all of us due to the evils of the past is not a matter of division, it is deeply unifying.\n\nI would definitely say it's at least more unifying than getting on a radio show and trying argue that the Civil War was about tariffs and that \"most blackface was done reverently,\" two real arguments put forth by Alex Jones' show in the past\n\nBut beyond all of that, I would again ask Alex, what could Obama have said that you would have been happy with? You seem to be mad that he is in any way recognizing the black experience in America, because you think that is \"dividing,\" so I am guessing that it would be best for him to just pretend that the black experience doesn't exist. Or, maybe it would just be best if he pretended the black experience was exactly the same as the white experience. Maybe it would be best if he just continued the long tradition of viewing the white male viewpoint as the default and the only one that really mattered?\n\nThis, ultimately, is at the core of why Alex Jones' \"deconstruction\" of Obama's inauguration does not work: there is nothing that Obama could say that would illicit a positive reaction out of Alex. No matter the input Obama gave Alex in the speech, it was going to be processed, and the output was going to be packaged as proof that Obama is a New World Order puppet and trying to destroy America.\n\nIt's ultimately just an uninspired and lazy piece of propaganda, made all the more embarrassing and amateurish by the fact that 10 minutes after he finishes his \"in-depth analysis\" of Obama's lies, he has his soap company sponsor as a guest on the show to ramble about soap and tell dirty limericks. What a complete mess this show is.\n"

While his show originally was an entertaining blend of testosterone, conspiracy dabbling, and pseudo-spirituality, it has shifted over the years to becoming a platform for malicious entities to soft-peddle awful rhetoric, more or less unquestioned. When Alex Jones was on the show, [http://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/knowledge-fight-joe-rogan-appearance Rogan allowed Alex to lie to his audience repeatedly] about very serious topics. When Rogan had Alex's economist friend Peter Schiff on, Rogan allowed Schiff to spread narratives about how everyone needs to buy gold because the dollar is going to collapse, only to reveal at the end of the show that he himself sells gold. This isn't even taking into account all of the horribly inaccurate and irresponsible shit he's allowed people like Milo, Ben Shapiro, Sam Harris, and many others to disseminate to his audience, seemingly lacking the ability or interest in debating their rhetoric. What I'm getting at is that Rogan is cool and fun, but he may not be as sharp of a critical thinker as he presents himself to be.\n*'''Art Acevedo''': Art Acevedo was, at the time, the Austin Chief of Police. He appears on InfoWars from time to time because he believes in community outreach, and in being accessible as a leader of the department. He and Alex enjoy a bit of a jocular relationship, with Acevedo doing mildly insulting but good-natured impressions of Alex to his face. His appearances are generally pleasant, but they're mostly just Alex asking if Acevedo has heard about various stories Alex read on WND or Zero Hedge, and Acevedo saying \"no.\"\n\n===Narratives===\n\nThere is a very interesting turning point that we can see starting to take shape on this episode of the show, namely that Alex Jones is starting to see the beginnings of what will become the Tea Party, and he realizes that he is not on the team.\n\nAlex is beginning to see his own worldview being imitated by Glenn Beck, and he's seeing his \"good buddy\" Ron Paul appearing on Beck's show, and it is starting to confuse him:\n\nIn reality, this should be the least confusing thing imaginable.\n\nIn 1984, Ron Paul was made the first chairman of Citizens For A Sound Economy, a think tank entirely funded by Charles and David Koch.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Ron Paul ran for the Republican primary. He came up real short, coming in 4th behind John McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Mitt Romney. To Paul's credit, he beat the shit out of Rudy Guliani, who ended up with a respectable zero delegates.\n\nRon Paul officially lost the nomination on June 12, 2008, and shortly after, the first public flickers of the Tea Party began to pop up in the wake of Paul's failed campaign, with [http://www.mndaily.com/article/2008/09/ron-paul-supporters-rally-target-center Paul kicking off his \"Campaign For Liberty\" on Sept. 2, 2008 at a rally] he was holding on that date specifically because he was not invited to speak at the Republican National Convention, happening Sept. 1-4, 2008 and Ron Paul is apparently petty as fuck.\n\nAfter this, chatter swirled that he would run on the Libertarian ticket or with the Constitution Party, but in the end, he endorsed Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party. Chuck, by the way, is a really fucked up Christian Fundamentalist who [https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/chuck-baldwin holds such positions] as \"the Zionists run the media,\" \"homosexuality is a moral perversion,\" and (this is a direct quote) \"I believe the South was right in the War Between the States, and I am not a racist.\" I'm relieved to hear that he's not a racist.\n\nRon Paul embodied the philosophy that really works out well for corporate monsters, but it turns out that in practice, people just don't really like him enough to vote for him when there are other options on the table. He ended up with only 5.6% of the popular vote in the 2008 primary. Really think about that; that is about 1/4 of what 3rd place finisher Huckabee ended up with. Ron Paul is not, and has never been, all that popular.\n\nThe entire time after the 2008 election, it was completely obvious that Ron Paul was going to run again, so the struggle for the extreme right became \"how do we find any votes for this guy who is not all that popular?\" Enter the Tea Party.\n\nIn her book [https://books.google.com/books?id=GDf4DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=tea+party+all+chiefs+no+indians&source=bl&ots=4alDldq0R8&sig=DvVkbHN2VIVg2WYwsvhpfONTEck&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiv-YLy1KTbAhXIFjQIHRZRAJcQ6AEIbDAN#v=onepage&q=tea%20party%20all%20chiefs%20no%20indians&f=false Dark Money], Jane Meyer quotes economist Bruce Bartlett:\n\n<blockquote>\"The problem with the whole Libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and no Indians. There weren't any actual people, like voters, who gave a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been trying to create an actual movement.\n\n\"</blockquote>\n\nThe Tea Party was the most successful attempt at creating a movement, and the Kochs did it through spending loads of money on conservative radio personalities like Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, and Mark Levin, [https://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/tea-party-radio-network-105774 funneling their money through organizations like FreedomWorks], filling in advertising losses caused by groups like the Heritage Foundation ceasing their support around this time.\n\nThe Tea Party grew, and did so largely because of the financial backing and co-opting of the movement by conservative billionaires, most importantly, the Kochs.\n\nTo get back to the point, Alex is beginning to see the roots of this movement happening, and he is realizing that he is on the outside looking in. He thought Ron Paul was his guy, but it turns out that Glenn Beck is actually on TV. Also, it turns out that the people who made Ron Paul the first chairman of their think tank 25 years prior are the same people who were in 2009 paying Glenn Beck millions.\n\nThe picture is far more complicated than this, and it's very likely that the Tea Party and trying to create an artificial movement against taxes has been something that has been in the works with the Kochs for years. That is not the most important piece for our interest. What is important here is that Alex is seeing this planned operation go live, and he is not a part of it. And he's Alex Goddamn Jones, the greatest patriot to ever hate taxes; he damn well should be a part of this thing.\n\nI highly suspect that this mentality will be pretty consistent in Alex for a while, until he most likely joins up as a propagandist for his \"good buddy\" Ron Paul's Tea Party team, and immediately changes a number of his positions (he somehow has to change his positions to becoming against net neutrality, becoming hostile toward Iran, becoming dismissive of police brutality, and abandoning his support for Palestinian rights, while retaining his clear love of Russia and his belief that climate change is a scam).\n\nAs for the rest of this show, it's really nothing too important.\n\nThe interview with Joe Rogan is kind of fun, because Joe is fun, but everything they talk about basically follows this pattern:\n\nAlex: *Says something outrageous, like \"Obama is worse than Hitler\"*\n\nJoe: \"That's crazy. Are you serious?\n\nAlex: \"I am very serious. I will give you zero proof of anything I say, but I know things\"\n\nJoe: \"That's amazing.\"\n\nIt's not Joe's job to rake Alex over the coals on Alex's own show, so this isn't meant to be a severe criticism of Joe, just a way of saying that the interview is not very interesting, unless you want to hear about how Fear Factor worked.\n\nThe only other important thing that happens on this episode is that Alex has an interview with Bob Chapman, who once again is on the show to talk about how the dollar is going to collapse any day now. Bob is presented as a financial expert, but he exists on this show solely to scare the audience enough to get them to a suggestible state where they will be receptive to Ted Anderson's sales pitch (Ted Anderson is the owner of the Genesis Communications Network, which broadcasts Alex's show, as well as Midas Resources, which sells gold/silver. It is an outrageous conflict of interests).\n\nThis is ridiculous in how brazen and open the scam is, but this is the sort of thing they do all the time on InfoWars. Potential Federal Trade Commission violations just kind of blend into the background when you do them all the time.\n"

It is about allegations that Chinese agents pushed misinformation, which Alex is pretending is about the entire coronavirus fear being the result of Chinese misinformation. This is a complete misrepresentation of [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-china-disinformation.html the actual article].\n*Alex claims that Covid-19 related deaths are being massively exaggerated, when [https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/social-media-posts-make-baseless-claim-on-covid-19-death-toll/ all credible sources] are suggesting the numbers are likely lower than the reality.\n*Alex doesn't understand that the Civil War happened [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8513069 before we understood how infectious diseases work], and that there were a bunch of outbreaks during that war that actually prolonged the conflict quite a bit. Also, Alex says that the Civil War was fought \"to give black people rights,\" which is a direct contradiction of everything else he's ever said about the Civil War.\n*Alex claims that there were Covid cases in the US in November 2019, when he's really just misrepresenting [https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/24/cuomo_the_coronavirus_that_came_to_new_york_did_not_come_from_china_it_came_from_europe.html the words of Gov. Andrew Cuomo].\n*Alex thinks that Ian Fleming wrote Moonraker to expose the Globalists' plans to hide out from a chemical weapon release on a space base. Alex doesn't realize that space was only a part of the movie version of Moonraker, which Fleming didn't write. The book version is very different, and Alex has no idea what he's talking about.\n*Alex's first guest, Shiva Ayydurai, hates Alex's second guest, Rashid Buttar. Because Alex won't cancel Buttar, Ayydurai storms off the show, and Alex ends up canceling the interview with Buttar for no reason. It is a real mess.\n*In an attempt to point out how few shark-related deaths there are each year, Alex chooses a random number, and accidentally severely embellishes the problem. He claims there's 30 a year, when in reality, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/21/shark-attacks-were-down-again-2019-only-2-deaths-worldwide/4502604002/ the average is 4].\n*Alex has decided to champion world hunger because it's convenient for him to now, though he hasn't cared much about the issue in the past.

Alex also doesn't wrestle with the fact that the people he's demonized his entire career, the UN, includes people on the forefront of working to solve this problem for as many people as they can. Alex is the villain in his own story.\n*Alex lies about [https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-assistant-who-says-lady-gaga-made-her-sleep-in-her-bed-will-get-her-day-in-court-2013-9 Lady Gaga having to sleep with a personal assistant] because she's afraid of demons.\n*Alex's story about ancient people being tricked by people who know about eclipses has [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Savage_in_Literature.html?id=E2jADAAAQBAJ a deep tradition in 1800's English literature] meant to reinforce white supremacy over the foolish \"savages.\"\n*Alex lies about [https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/cdcs-failed-coronavirus-tests-were-tainted-with-coronavirus-feds-confirm/ a story about coronavirus tests being tainted].

He appears to be misremembering a bit of debate about organ donation guidelines that was covered [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/us/controversy-erupts-over-organ-removals.html by the New York Times] in 1997.\n*Alex and David Knight pretend that the inevitable additional cases of coronavirus and deaths that come after states open up prematurely are proof of some kind of conspiracy.

They just say they are Advanced Persistent Threat Groups of hackers, which is not country specific.\n*Alex's story from the \"Financial Telegraph\" is actually from the \"[https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/features/2020-05-05-lockdown-disaster-dwarfs-covid-19-say-sa-actuaries/ Financial Mail].\" It discusses the effects of the virus outbreak vs. the effects of the lockdown, as it relates to South Africa, but it paints a pretty different picture than Alex paints.\n*Alex is correct that Marie Antoinette didn't actually say \"let them eat cake,\" but his theories about who actually did [https://www.britannica.com/story/did-marie-antoinette-really-say-let-them-eat-cake are not supported by historians].\n*Alex's complaints about Marie Antoinette playing badminton while her people starved is way too much of a parallel with Trump [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/17/fact-check-trump-had-rallies-golfed-covid-19-outbreak-grew/5126918002/ going golfing frequently during the pandemic]\n*Alex tries to get in on the action with the new hot \"documentary\" Plandemic.

      "Dan and Jordan discuss Alex Jones' descent into acceptance of military police arresting protesters for being out past curfew, which seems counter to any number of films called \"Police State\" that he sold earlier in his career.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/research/2020/6/3/episode-440-june-1-2-2020 Episode 440: June 1-2, 2020]</ref>\n\nTopics covered include:\n\n*Alex and Infowars have been accused of setting fire to a mattress owned by a man experiencing homelessness. There doesn't appear to be any proof that Alex or anyone from Infowars did this, and Dan discusses how making this accusation without proof is a detrimental strategy.\n*Alex reports on a video he claims shows George Floyd dropping a bag of white powder while in police custody. The video is inconclusive, and Alex cannot prove that this is a bag of white powder, or even that Floyd dropped anything. (Not going to link to Alex's site, but you can find the video on his sites)\n*Alex claims to have researched Floyd, but seems to have missed the part about [https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/may/george-floyd-ministry-houston-third-ward-church.html his involvement in ministry].\n*Alex's employee Savannah Hernandez expresses a position that if you don't resist arrest, police won't kill you. This is particularly dumb, considering [https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/05/breonna-taylor-is-one-of-a-shocking-number-of-black-people-to-see-armed-police-barge-into-their-homes/ the case of Breonna Taylor], and this kind of position is absolutely counter to everything Infowars supposedly stands for.\n*Alex claims that Acme Brick is setting up pallets of bricks for protesters to use around the country. He claims that Acme is owned by Bill Gates. The [https://brick.com/history-acme-brick history of the ownership of the company] is complicated, but ultimately it [https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/jun2000.html has been a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway since 2000].\n*Alex found the narrative about Acme Brick from a random QAnon twitter account named Elyse Cane. Elyse in no way proves that Acme Brick is dropping off bricks, and Alex can in no way demonstrate this claim.\n*A new [https://www.newsweek.com/george-floyd-was-fentanyl-medical-examiner-says-experts-dispute-cause-death-1507982 release] from [https://www.nytimes.com/article/george-floyd-autopsy-michael-baden.html the Hennepin County Medical Examiner] has claimed that George Floyd had fentanyl in his system. Alex exaggerates this.

Apparently, that is coming eventually.\n*Millie also thinks that protesters become terrorists just by staying out past curfew. Something tells me she would not be a big fan of various instances of nonviolent resistance over history.\n*Alex has his son on the show to discuss how he beat up someone at a convenience store.\n*Alan Keys drops by to advocate for Trump calling up citizens to form militias. He also thinks Trump should deputize people.\n"

It's a disgraceful and racist idea, and is almost certainly going to be a giant failure. [http://wecantbreathe.org/ We Can't Breathe] is already the name of a community organization.\n*Alex's movement seems to mostly about a march in Austin against mask-wearing. [https://dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/additionaldata/ Covid-19 cases are currently exploding in Texas], so this is probably going to end poorly.\n*Alex implies that the [https://pagesix.com/2020/06/23/steve-bing-suicide-spurred-by-money-drugs-and-mental-health-struggle/ recent death by suicide of producer Steve Bing] was somehow related to pedophilia. There is no evidence to support this claim.\n*Alex interviews Gavin McInnes about how he got kicked off YouTube. It's very sad, and is mostly a plug for Gavin's depressing subscription site Censored Dot Tv.\n*[https://twitter.com/goldsbie/status/1174767491261898753?lang=en Gavin McInnes has done blackface]. Also, he's written op-eds [https://www.fivefeetoffury.com/2014/03/07/gavin-mcinnes-whats-wrong-with-blackface/ defending blackface].\n*Alex interviews James O'Keefe and his new \"Facebook whistleblower\" Zach McElroy. Zach actually worked for Cognizant, which is a different company, which Facebook contracted to do moderation work. All of the information Zach has revealed is inconclusive, and at worst implicates Cognizant, not necessarily Facebook.\n*It was widely reported in late 2019 that [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50247540 Cognizant was stepping away from content moderation] on social media.

      "Dan and Jordan discuss a couple days on The Alex Jones Show where Alex is trying very hard to demonize the idea of wearing masks to limit the spread of Covid-19.<ref>[https://knowledgefight.com/research/2020/7/19/episode-450-june-25-26-2020 Episode 450: June 25-26, 2020]</ref>\n\nTopics covered include:\n\n*Alex has seen some viral videos purporting to show that wearing masks raises CO2 levels you're breathing to dangerous levels. This [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/masks-dangerous-health/ has been debunked], and is kind of silly even just at face value. If wearing a mask for a short period of time had any legitimate health risks, there would be many activities that would be nearly impossible, like motorcycle trips or skiing.\n*Alex rewrites the story of the noose that was found at Bubba Wallace's NASCAR garage in order to turn it into a story of a racism-hoax. His details of the story are inaccurate.\n*Alex hand-waives the rising cases of Covid-19 in the US because there are not also sharply increasing death numbers. This does not take into account that deaths are a lagging indicator when it comes to health emergencies. Typically death numbers do not rise immediately, it takes a while after case numbers rise.\n*Alex says that his enemies need to \"go on helicopter rides,\" which is a reference to the way Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would kill his political rivals. Pinochet has become a bit of a hero of the current fascist right-wing, mostly because they know they can't get away with wearing shirts that say \"Hitler Did Nothing Wrong.\"\n*Alex thinks that Hillary Clinton and Obama are going to run for president and vice president in the 2020 election. It is too late for them to run within the Democratic party, and it seems entirely unbelievable to think they'd run third party. Alex is kind of just making stuff up.\n*Alex claims that Black Lives Matter wants to destroy the nuclear family. This is just an intentional misrepresentation of [https://www.mediamatters.org/black-lives-matter/right-wing-media-claim-black-lives-matter-advocates-against-family-through their actual position]. If you read their statement of beliefs, it's clear that it's about viewing each other as family, regardless of blood relation, not about destroying any family structure. They're also very explicit about respecting parental relations, which upholds familial structures.\n*Alex and his guest, Rev. Childress, discuss how Martin Luther King Jr. was against riots. This is in opposition to one of [https://time.com/3838515/baltimore-riots-language-unheard-quote/ his most famous quotes], and [https://timeline.com/by-the-end-of-his-life-martin-luther-king-realized-the-validity-of-violence-4de177a8c87b the later positions he was coming to] before his assassination. It's a longstanding tradition to shame protesters for not being saintly enough to have their concerns heard, and this is just Alex's racist version of it.\n*Alex and Childress lie about the relationship between Hitler and Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger. Sanger was [https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.php explicitly anti-Nazi], and Hitler hated Sanger because she worked to increase access to birth control. If all the Aryan women were able to make their own decisions about reproduction, it would hurt the growth of the Third Reich, which was a big concern of his. Sanger and Hitler were not on the same page, regardless of what anti-abortion liars say over and over.\n*Alex pretends that Joe Biden actually said that 120 million people in the US have died from Covid-19, when in reality he had just misspoke. Alex forgot to cut off the part of the clip where Biden begins to correct himself, because he's terrible at his job.\n*Alex incorrectly reports that the CDC says that masks don't work at all. He claims that they admit that you wearing a mask will not stop you from spreading the virus, if you're sick. In reality, [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html the page he's found on the CDC website] is about masks with valves, which most everyday masks do not have. This story is a dud. You can find [https://www.insider.com/masks-with-a-breathable-valve-are-useless-experts-warn-2020-5 tons of stories] from [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8266171/Bay-Area-says-masks-valves-not-acceptable-face-protection-amid-coronavirus-pandemic.html back in April] and [https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/05/27/nation/wearing-face-mask-with-valve-it-might-be-time-find-something-else-some-experts-say/ May about how] [https://www.fastcompany.com/90496717/what-is-a-mask-valve-and-why-are-cities-banning-them masks with valves are not effective] at stopping viral transmission.\n*Alex has started a website called We Can't Breathe, attempting to hijack the police brutality movement and use it against masks. It's pathetic, racist, and also doesn't seem to be working. Anyway, [https://www.statesman.com/news/20200627/adler-austin-has-nationrsquos-highest-7-day-metro-positivity-rate-of-coronavirus-tests?fbclid=IwAR3eVRaU0q5ar41HreYzSjKRrLTQP_pi8Df5mfqOQUHa_fdp_ssduAK9d5Q&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=web_push cases of Covid-19 in Austin are exploding], so this is a really bad idea.\n*Alex tries to interview his anti-communist hero G. Edward Griffin, but unfortunately Griffin is not really all that into Trump. Because Alex is a coward and can't argue with someone with as high of stature as Griffin, and because Griffin doesn't give a shit about Alex's scam, this leads to Alex suggesting that the Globalists actually wanted Trump to get elected to negotiate a better position with China. He will absolutely forget about this and never bring it up again.\n"

There is no evidence of that on Infowars' website, nor on his mirror site, Prison Planet.\n\n[[File:https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58bc3c86b8a79bbdc67b182c/1595218479899-Z46PF38RH7KLDYH27GLR/NoEpsteinOnPrisonPlanet.JPG|thumb|none]]\n\n*Alex has absolutely no idea how to pronounce Ghislaine Maxwell's name.\n*Alex pretends that the removal of Geoffrey Berman, attorney at the Southern District of NY, was due to Berman not allowing the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell to happen. No evidence for this is provided, and it seems more likely that he was removed because he was investigating Trump's associates.\n*Alex interviews a guy named Larry Gaiters, who claims that various words have completely made up roots. He says that \"negro\" comes from the Greek word \"necro\" ([https://www.etymonline.com/word/negro it does not]) and that the word media comes from the Hebrew word for witches.\n*Alex misrepresents [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/ an Atlantic article from May] about Covid test reporting inconsistencies. He claims that numbers are all just being made up, but this article is about how there were some states that were reporting negative results to viral and antibody tests as a single figure, which makes the data difficult to interpret. This was brought up, and corrected.\n*Alex [https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408.pdf lies about a study] about how cities that had Black Lives Matter protests in them actually saw increased social distancing behavior, and it may have helped decrease transmission. Alex hasn't read the study, and is just making up what it says.\n*Alex realized that he did a bad job on his regular show, so he returns in the evening to do a 2 hour special emergency report about Ghislaine Maxwell's arrest. He seems very drunk, says nothing meaningful, rants about his ex-wife, almost starts crying a few times, and bails with half an hour left in the planned show. It was an absolutely embarrassing and childish display, but far from the worst Alex has been on air.\n"

The confusion is about the head of GM saying that [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/16/general-motors-gm-bailout-repayment/4043607/ the company will not pay back all $10 billion] that was part of the package. This is because not all of that money was a loan, and there was no obligation for them to repay money that wasn't a loan. A lot of the money that was used to bail out GM was in the form of government buying stock, and GM is not required to repay that. Ultimately, [https://money.cnn.com/2014/05/29/news/companies/gm-profit-bailout/index.html GM did pay back everything they owed]. If you want to argue that they should have paid back more, that's an okay position to have, but it's a different point than Alex was trying to make.\n*Alex lies about GM plants in China creating cars for the US market. There are factories in China because there is a giant car market in China. [https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/05/business/trump-barra-gm-fact-check/index.html Approximately 1% of US GM sales are cars from China].\n*Alex tries to scare his audience about Google buying robotics companies, saying they're trying to create a robot army. Google had [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-buys-8-robotics-companies-in-6-months-why/ recently bought some robotics companies], but [https://www.vox.com/2017/6/8/15766440/softbank-alphabet-google-robotics-boston-dynamics-schaft they've since sold them]. They were investments and part of their developmental wing.\n*Alex exaggerates the level of scurvy that people in the US experience in the present day. There are [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567249/#:~:text=8-,Deficiency,of%20irregular%20or%20inadequate%20intake. some people who will get scurvy], but most people who are at risk are people who have other related factors in their lives, like alcoholism or drug abuse, which affect their body's absorption of vitamin C.\n*Alex lies about salt not having iodine in it. He specifically uses a sea salt to make his point, but fails to clarify that it's a commonly-known fact that [https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/sea-salt/faq-20058512 sea salt doesn't contain iodine]. Table salt still does, and almost everyone in the US gets plenty of iodine that way.\n*Alex lies about [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/ an article in Scientific American] about soil depletion. The short version of this is that scientists have studied soil depletion, and they initially believed that it was likely the result of non-organic agricultural practices. Subsequent research has shown that [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/vanishing-nutrients/ it is more likely that the phenomenon is related to climate change], and that vitamin/mineral depletion is connected to increased levels of CO2.\n*Alex insults Caitlin Upton, the woman who competed at the 2007 Miss Teen USA pageant and had a bad answer about education. Two people who Alex loves in 2020 were big fans of Ms. Upton.

It is actually impossible for the planets to physically align, that's just an expression that is used to describe a situation when planets appear in the same area in the sky. Alex just got this 2161 nonsense from a Facebook meme.\n*Alex claims that crime goes up during full moons. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1444800/?page=1 A study from 1984] did find a correlation between crime and the full moon, but subsequent studies have been very mixed in their findings.\n*Alex claims that he inspired the Foo Fighter's song The Pretender.

[https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2017/02/17/insights-proxmire-foia-advice.aspx This is not true]. You can find all sorts of information about government contractors on [https://foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/home the FOIA portal].\n*One of Millie's experts, Patrick Bergy alleges to be [https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2005/10/27/bound-for-boot-camp-he-s-booted-from-his-job/ the first 40 year old private in the US military]. He also ran for [https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2004/10/11/independent-candidate-strives-to-be-heard/ Pasco County Election Supervisor], which [https://www.pascovotes.gov/portals/pasco/Results/gen04all.htm did not result in a victory]. After the campaign, Bergy [http://www.fec.state.fl.us/FECWebFi.nsf/0/EB6EA80B40C7CA6485257C2F00735CDA/$file/158.pdf didn't pay a fine] when told to by the commission, and eventually [http://www.fec.state.fl.us/FECWebFi.nsf/0/7C014BB7366B7E6785257C0E00587C5B/$file/206.pdf negotiated a settlement].\n*Patrick Bergy's story largely relies on appeals to stories about IIA, or Interactive Internet Activity. The primary source about this is [https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/dod/dod060807.pdf a 2007 memo] which discusses public relations guidelines for interactive internet engagement of DoD personnel in certain foreign countries. It does not appear to be anything close to what they claim.\n*Patrick Bergy wrote a book called [https://www.amazon.com/Victim-Swamp-State-Destroyed-Private/dp/1977646468 Victim Of The Swamp].\n*Millie says that upstream collection of data is a large part of what the NSA does, but this is not accurate. A 2011 report found that [https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/fisc_opinion_10.3.2011.pdf 9% of internet data collected] was upstream collection, as opposed to stuff acquired directly from ISPs. Also, the NSA reported that they [https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/1618699/nsa-stops-certain-section-702-upstream-activities/ amended their upstream collection practices] in April 2017.\n*The [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/us/politics/22passport.html 2008 passport data breach] involved contractors from [https://web.archive.org/web/20080324040415/http://deepbackground.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/21/794799.aspx Stanley Inc and The Analysis Group]. It did not involve CGI, although [https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2010/05/07/cgi-buys-stanley.aspx CGI did acquire Stanley in 2010], two years later.\n*The Analysis Corporation is a [https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/The_Analysis_Corporation wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Strategies Group].\n*Millie thinks that CGI stands for Canadian Global Information, because those words are in the first line of their Wikipedia page. The name actually stands for [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/10/16/meet-cgi-federal-the-company-behind-the-botched-launch-of-healthcare-gov/ Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique].\n*The John Brennan quid-pro-quo theory does not make sense, given that [https://web.archive.org/web/20110507023129/http://www.northjersey.com/news/120509_North_Bergen_man_is_homeland_security_assistant_for_President_Obama.html he was a high level Obama advisor prior to the passport breach], and was clearly on a short-list to be in the administration.\n*The PRISM program did not involve upstream collections of data.\n*Dynology has received [https://www.usaspending.gov/#/search/b174b27784aef45c8a6b0640ee63792c many government contracts] over the years. [https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/CONT_AWD_W912PE08P7083_9700_-NONE-_-NONE- One of these contracts] involves work that was performed in Germany, which Millie is claiming involves the Congressional Knowledge Management Service. This is based on her seeing the acronym \"CMKS\" on the contract, which she took to mean Congressional Knowledge Management Service, although the acronym for that should be CKMS. In cloud computing, CMKS is an abbreviation for Customer Master Keys, so it is entirely possible that this is what this contract was for, and there's no evidence provided that it has anything to do with the Congressional Knowledge Management Service.\n*Patrick Bergy asserts that the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 made it legal for the US government to propagandize the US population. This is [https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/ a misunderstanding that apparently began with a sloppy column in Buzzfeed], which took on a life of its own. The Smith-Mundt Act of 2012 only made it so programs created by the Broadcasting Board of Governors could be accessible in the US, primarily because with the internet as it is, there's basically no way to stop it, and because these programs may be the preferred news sources of diaspora communities in the US. The Act itself explicitly lays out that [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-112hr5736ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr5736ih.pdf money allocated to these organizations cannot be used to sway public opinion in the US].\n*Patrick Bergy seems to think that every recent instance of non-white communities expressing dissatisfaction with things like police violence are examples of people being swayed by Department of Defense IIA operations. The documentary doesn't include instances of white identity protests being accused of being IIA, which is weird.\n*Patrick Bergy's story seems to [https://www.victimoftheswamp.com/2020/02/22/the-witness-obamas-shadownet/ include a whole lot of instances] of him being rebuffed by prominent people, like Matt Gaetz and Dan Bongino, after he approaches them about ShadowNet. The fact that they won't sign onto his conspiracy theory seems to consistently be taken as evidence that they themselves are involved in the ShadowNet conspiracy.\n*Millie's other expert, Tore, [https://www.infowars.com/breaking-new-evidence-confirms-kentucky-election-fraud/ was also Millie's primary source] for her \"reporting\" about questions surrounding the 2019 election in Kentucky.\n*Tore's [https://www.propublica.org/article/misinformation-efforts-over-kentucky-vote-could-be-playbook-for-2020 full name is Terpsichore Lindeman], and her claims about voter roll discrepancy were debunked by ProPublica.\n*Tore was [https://attorneygeneral.nd.gov/news/attorney-general-details-investigation-unlicensed-business-alleged-fraud-tore-maras-lindeman investigated by the North Dakota attorney general] for inappropriately soliciting charitable donations in 2018. She also decided to [https://www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Second-candidate-running-in-Minot-mayoral-race-468072953.html run for mayor of Minot, North Dakota] on a platform of Make Minot Great Again. [https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2018/06/election-results-upheld-in-official-tally/ She did not make it to the ballot]. Fellow citizens started [https://www.change.org/p/concerned-citizens-of-minot-prohibit-tore-maras-lindeman-from-running-for-mayor-in-minot-nd a Change.org petition] to stop her from running for mayor.\n*In 2011, Tore is listed as an undergraduate student in biology at the University of Kentucky, in the [https://www.uky.edu/chellgren/sites/www.uky.edu.chellgren/files/FINAL%20ABSTRACT%20BOOK.pdf program for their Showcase of Undergraduate Scholars].\n*However, [https://medium.com/immigration-policy/usa-language-confidential-8aec1c253d96 according to her own Medium page], she claims that she was in medical school in 2008. In Millie's documentary, she also claims that she was working on secret projects for John Brennan in 2008, which seems like a problem. [https://navy.togetherweserved.com/usn/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?ID=506419&cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&type=Person Her page on TogetherWeServed] also claims to have been attending the University of Kentucky in 2008.\n*[https://medium.com/@drlindeman Tore's Medium page] was largely about issues related to foreign language interpreting and serving immigrant communities, until August 2016, when the tone completely changed and it became a very intense conspiracy, pro-Trump blog. Even as her writing shifted into being about the evil forces conspiring about Trump, she did not claim to have first-hand knowledge of these evil forces, which she does claim now, which seems weird.\n*Robert Storch was [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-key-additions-administration-2/ re-nominated by Trump in June 2017]. In December, [https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/1618765/robert-storch-confirmed-as-national-security-agency-inspector-general/ he was confirmed by the Senate] as the Inspector General of the NSA. Millie says that it \"appears he was never actually confirmed,\" which makes no sense.\n*Paul Manafort was not the only [https://www.thedailybeast.com/rick-gates-tells-mueller-about-trump-teams-dealings-with-israeli-intelligence-firm Trump campaign connection to Psy-Group].\n*Shawn Lucas was in a video serving papers to the DNC, but he was [https://heavy.com/news/2016/11/shawn-lucas-cause-of-death-drugs-released-kratom-fentanyl-dnc-process-server-democratic-national-committee-hillary-clinton-conspiracy-theory-theories-seth-rich/ just employed as a process server]. It was not his lawsuit. Though tragic, the claim that his death was suspicious or a murder has not been substantiated at all.\n*Trump did not make it so people lose their security clearances when they leave their jobs. Because of [https://clearedjobs.net/security-clearance-faqs how clearances work], this would be a logistical and administrative nightmare and create so much more bureaucracy.\n*Millie read the first paragraph of [https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/196207/UNICRI%20-%20Artificial%20intelligence%20and%20robotics%20for%20law%20enforcement.pdf an Interpol report] about robotics and law enforcement and reported on it. She neglects to mention any of the relevant content of the report.\n*Millie found a [https://patents.justia.com/patent/20170061345 2017 patent] for employee surveillance technology owned by Dynology. She presents this outside of the workplace context, and misrepresents the patent. She also fails to point out this is just an updating of an existing 2015 patent.\n"
